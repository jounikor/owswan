To try and create a full install from here, try:

builder rel os_nt

use os_os2 for the OS/2 installers or os_dos or os_linux, what is appropriate

General stuff.
=================================

Sample commands to create setup.inf script for C/C++:

langdat c
mksetup -i..\include -dDstDir=C:\WATCOM c filelist %RELROOT%

or, on Linux

langdat.exe c
mksetup -i../include -dDstDir= c filelist $RELROOT

To create F77 install script, simply replace 'c' with 'f77'. These
details are likely to change.



Variables used in install scripts
=================================

Each product has its own install script and installer. Within each
product, a set of conditions determines which files should be installed.
