WATCOM C/C++ Version 10.5 - README
----------------------------------

Welcome to WATCOM C/C++ version 10.5.  This README provides helpful hints
found during testing as well as updated information that was not available
at the time the documentation was produced.

Note: %DstDir% represents the directory in which WATCOM C/C++ was installed.
      %WinSysDir% represents your Windows 3.x system directory.
   
1.  When debugging a 32-bit Phar Lap, TNT or DOS/4GW application, make sure
    that "run386.exe", "tnt.exe", or "dos4gw.exe" respectively, are in your
    path.  Failure to do so, may cause your computer to hang.
   
2. When using the GUI debugger to debug Windows 3.x applications, certain
   Windows applications may cause the debugger to behave in an unpredictable
   way.  Typically, this occurs when debugging certain messages in window
   callback functions.  For example, hitting a breakpoint in a window
   function that is processing a WM_INITDIALOG message will crash the system.
   If this happens, the character-mode version of the debugger should be
   used.
   
3. When debugging the Windows 3.x MFC 2.5 samples contained in
   "%DstDir%\src\mfc\v25" enter the following in the source path to see the
   MFC source in the debugger source window.
   
   	%DstDir%\src\mfc\v25\*.cpp
	
   Similarly, when debugging the Windows NT MFC 3.0 samples contained in
   "%DstDir%\src\mfc\v30" enter the following in the source path to see the
   MFC source in the debugger source window.
   
   	%DstDir%\src\mfc\v30\*.cpp
   
   The source path can be changed by selecting "Source Path" in the "File"
   menu.

4. In order to use CodeWright with our IDE, you will need to change the
   "cwright.ini" file.  This file contains the following line.

	;LibPreload=cwdde.dll

   Uncomment this line by removing the ';' character.  This is required to
   enable communication between the IDE and CodeWright when "weditcw.dll"
   is selected as the editor interface DLL from the IDE.
    
5. If you choose to not install help files onto your hard disk, you will not
   be able to get help on the C library or MFC library from the editor.
    
6. Parallel remote debug servers do not work in an OS/2 session.  They can
   be used in an OS/2 DOS session.
    
7. When configuring the browser to use the CodeWright editor interface, you
   must specify "weditcw.dll" as the editor DLL, save the new options, exit
   the browser, and restart the browser.  Failure to do this will cause an
   exception to occur in the CodeWright interface DLL.
   
8. If you have installed the Win32 SDK and MFC help files onto your hard disk,
   there will be duplicate help files for Win32 and OLE.  You can delete
   "win32.hlp" and "ole.hlp" form the %DstDir%\binnt directory and reference
   the Win32 and OLE help from the MFC help.
   
9. Under OS/2, if you are debugging a DOS application from the IDE, you
   must ensure that %DstDir%\binw is in your DOS path so that when the IDE
   starts a DOS session to debug your application, the remote server can find
   its support files.
   
10. Under OS/2, you must ensure that the "Comet cursor" desktop setting is
    disabled if you want to debug PM applications.  By default, this setting
    is disabled.
    
   
Using Blue Sky Visual Programmer 2.0
------------------------------------

The following outlines the steps required to create a Visual Programmer
application.

1. Run the Watcom IDE.

2. From the File menu, select the New project menu item.

3. The "Project Filename" dialog will appear.  Choose a project file name and
   directory.
   
	Example: c:\tmp\test.wpj
	
   Press <OK>.

4. The "New Target" dialog will appear.   
   Click the "MFC - 32-bit (3.0)" button or the "MFC - 16-bit (2.5)" button to
   choose the target type.
   Type the target file name.  This is the name of the executable you want to
   build.
   
	Example: c:\tmp\test.exe
	
   Press <OK>.
    
5. Run Visual programmer by selecting the Visual Programmer option from the
   Targets menu.
    
6. The Visual Programmer "New" dialog will appear.  Select an application
   template as a starting place for your application.  The working directory
   and file name are determined by the target location specified in the
   Watcom IDE.  Press <OK> when you are done.
    
7. Use Visual Programmer to develop the application.    

   See Visual Programmer Help for more details.
	
   Be sure to try out the "Quick Run" option.  This tests the appearance of
   the program without actually having to generate any code.
    
8. Return to the IDE by pressing the <Return to Watcom IDE> toolbar button.
   Do not shut down Visual programmer until you have finished generating code.

9. Press the <Make the Current Target> toolbar button or, from the Target
   menu, select the Make option.
    
10. A Visual Programmer Message box will prompt you:

    "Save and Generate code for current design"
    
    Press <Yes>.  This is the same as choosing the V.P. "Save & Generate code"
    option.

11. The Visual Programmer window will come to the front and the application
    code will generated.

12. The IDE window will then come back to the front and will finish the 
    process of compiling and linking the program to create the executable
    file.
