WATCOM FORTRAN 77 Version 10.5 - README
---------------------------------------

Welcome to WATCOM FORTRAN 77 version 10.5.  This README provides helpful
hints found during testing as well as updated information that was not
available at the time the documentation was produced.

Note: %DstDir% represents the directory in which WATCOM FORTRAN 77 was
      installed.  %WinSysDir% represents your Windows 3.x system directory.
      
1.  When debugging a 32-bit Phar Lap, TNT or DOS/4GW application, make sure
    that "run386.exe", "tnt.exe", or "dos4gw.exe" respectively, are in your
    path.  Failure to do so, may cause your computer to hang.
   
2. When using the GUI debugger to debug Windows 3.x applications, certain
   Windows applications may cause the debugger to behave in an unpredictable
   way.  Typically, this occurs when debugging certain messages in window
   callback functions.  For example, hitting a breakpoint in a window
   function that is processing a WM_INITDIALOG message will crash the system.
   If this happens, the character-mode version of the debugger should be
   used.
   
3. In order to use CodeWright with our IDE, you will need to change the
   "cwright.ini" file.  This file contains the following line.

	;LibPreload=cwdde.dll

   Uncomment this line by removing the ';' character.  This is required to
   enable communication between the IDE and CodeWright when "weditcw.dll"
   is selected as the editor interface DLL from the IDE.
    
4. Parallel remote debug servers do not work in an OS/2 session.  They can
   be used in an OS/2 DOS session.
   
5. Under OS/2, if you are debugging a DOS application from the IDE, you
   must ensure that %DstDir%\binw is in your DOS path so that when the IDE
   starts a DOS session to debug your application, the remote server can find
   its support files.
   
6. Under OS/2, you must ensure that the "Comet cursor" desktop setting is
   disabled if you want to debug PM applications.  By default, this setting
   is disabled.
