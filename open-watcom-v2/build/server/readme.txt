BUILD SERVER OVERVIEW
=====================

See the file install.txt if you are interesting in setting up a build server.

This folder contains the scripts and documentation for an Open Watcom build
server. The idea is to build and test the system automatically every day. The
scripts then create reports on how things went.

This file is largely a placeholder at this time.
