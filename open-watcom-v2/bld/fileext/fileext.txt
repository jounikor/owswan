Rationale for adding new extentions to Open Watcom data files:
--------------------------------------------------------------

- The graphical user interface is here to stay (doh!) and is in fact
  even preferred over command line tools by a *large* majority.
- Many of the file extensions in use by Open Watcom today are the same 
  as in use by other programs, but with no file format compatibility.
- In a GUI, the file extensions can normally be used to tie file content
  information and standard or custom functions in the desktop or
  utility programs together. This can be interesting functionality 
  in console mode too, with a shell like Midnight Commander or the like.
- In some cases the existing extensions collide with other systems that
  are not likely to change. One such example is .lnk, which is expected
  to signify a shortcut in Explorer/shell in WIN32.
- There is no intention to invalidate or disable use of the extensions
  in use today. The intention is to define supplemental sets (but default in
  new projects and new distributions) to enable better shell integration.
- The unique, non 8.3 conforming column is only planned at this stage. It
  is defined to show plans to support *guaranteed* unique extension names 
  on modern file systems with virtually unlimited extension length 
  support. According to current Open Watcom project goals, the 8.3 system
  will be observed for as long as deemed necessary.
- The implementation/registration of support for OW extentions in the 
  OS shell must be totally controlled by the user. Enabling/disabling 
  support should be possible on a per extension basis, and restoring old 
  value if something was overwritten by previous selction must be possible.
  Therefore the suggested "enabler" for this is at post-installation
  time, in a new dialog in the IDE, or in a new utility program designed 
  for this purpose only.
- Some OS shell integration features can be (but is not limited to):
  - Double click -> auto-start application from associated data file
  - OS fileview popup menu action(s), can be more than one per extension
  - Data file drag/drop support from OS fileview to OW tools
  - OW tools as default handlers for well known file extensions
  - Recognizeable image for each OW supported file type in host OS filesview

Based on the rationale above, and on feedback from newsgroup,
the list below is started, and will be updated and maintained until
such a time when design/implementation can be started.

.int    .owi         .owlocale       binnt   bin   ?                 Some type of locale info?
.uni    .owu         .owunicode      binw    bin   ?
.NNN    .NNN         .NNN            binw    bin                     Non-constant extension

.mak    .owm         .owmake                 text  wmake             Conflicts with other make programs
.lnk    .owl         .owlink         binw    text  wmake             Explorer thinks .lnk is a shortcut

.dbg                                 binw    text  wd/wdw            Only possible to load manually.
.trp                                 binw    bin   wd                DOS only, no need for new ext.
.prs    .owp         .owlangdef      binw    bin   wd/wdw            Src expression syntax file
.d32    .d32                                 bin   wd OS/2 trap      May change to .dll in future

The extensions below represents text files in general meant to be read by 
humans for informational purposes. All of the in use in OW today.
So far, most seems not to want to create a new extension for that,
just rename all to .txt. (Ignore read only usage property)

.doc    .txt                                 text  read only
.w32    .txt                                 text  read only
.txt    .txt                                 text  read only
.faq    .txt                                 text  read only

The extensions below is a list of general, well known extensions, 
that could be handled in a commonly expected fashion, by one ore more 
of th OW tools. They should be possbile to associate with OW tools
if the users wants it.

.c .h .cpp .hpp .for .fi .asm .inc .mak .txt

.rc .dlg .ico .bmp .cur .res (.dll .exe)
