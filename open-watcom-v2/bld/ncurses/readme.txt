This is a stripped down version of ncurses, only the components
necessary to compile the Linux versions of Watcom VI and WD are
kept -- that is, the terminfo parts.

The files are, modulo a few #if's and #define's, and some 8+3
filename adjustments, the same as the ones in ncurses-5.3,
which can be downloaded at
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/pub/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.3.tar.gz
whilst the code is part of the GNU project it is not licensed
under the GPL but under MIT-style license similar to the one
used for X. It is compatible with the Open Watcom license.
