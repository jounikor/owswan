// Note: Suppose the user creates a DLL that contains C/C++ and FORTRAN
// object files and LibMain() is written in C/C++ (i.e. it's his own or the
// default one in the C library).  Suppose he then calls a FORTRAN subroutine
// from his DLL and the FORTRAN subroutine does some FORTRAN I/O.  Since the
// FORTRAN 77 library version of LibMain() is not called, he must call
// __FInitDLL() and __FTermDLL() explicitly from his C or C++ version of
// LibMain().  Also, he must call __FInitThrd() and __FTermThrd() on thread
// initialization and termination.
