//
// KWLOOKUP  : look up a keyword in a table
//
// The binary lookup scheme does not always work for us. However, when it does,
// it works very quickly (a maximum of 7 tries (128 = 2**7) for the statement
// keyword list). It also works quite often. When it fails we resort to a
// sequential search of a subset of the keywords.
