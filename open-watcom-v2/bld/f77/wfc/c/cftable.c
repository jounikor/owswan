// Note: If you wish to add a new statement processor, there are four files
//       that need changing: PRDEFN.H, KWLIST.C, PROCTBL.C, CFTABLE.C

#include "ctrlflgs.h"
#include "global.h"
#include "cftable.h"


#define BD      CF_BAD_DO_ENDING
#define NS      CF_NOT_SIMPLE_STMT
#define NE      CF_NOT_EXECUTABLE
#define BB      CF_BAD_BRANCH_OBJECT
#define SL      CF_NEED_SET_LINE
#define SS      CF_SPECIFICATION

// These control flags are used for various purposes.

// BAD_DO_ENDING     - these are statements that cannot be allowed on the
//                     terminal statement of a regular FORTRAN DO loop
// NOT_SIMPLE_STMT   - these are statements that cannot be allowed as the
//                     object of a logical IF or ATEND statement
// NOT_EXECUTABLE    - these are not executable statements and have
//                     certain restrictions outlined in the FORTRAN
//                     standard
// BAD_BRANCH_OBJECT - these are statements that would be meaningless if
//                     they were branched to
// NEED_SET_LINE     - before most statements are compiled, there needs to
//                     be a run time call emitted to set the line number
//                     currently executed
//                     WHILE and ELSEIF are special cases because they
//                     generate the run time call themselves so that the
//                     SetLine procedure will be called at the right time
// SPECIFICATION     - these statements are specification statements
//                     and must be compiled before a function/subroutine
//                     prologue is emitted.
// SUBPROGRAM        - SUBROUTINE, (typ)FUNCTION, BLKDATA, PROGRAM stmts
//                     also all type declaration statements have this bit
//                     on since typ*lenFUNCTION starts a subprogram
// BLOCK_DATA        - these statements are the only ones allowed in
//                     a BLOCK DATA subprogram
// DBUG_BEFORE_LINE  - need to call debugger ISN routine before statement
//                     processed
// IMPLICIT_LABEL    - used to flag those statements which have an
//                     implicit label (ENDIF, ENDGUESS, ENDATEND)
// NOT_IN_STRUCTURE  - used to flag those specification statements which cannot
//                     appear in a structure definition
// NOT_IN_UNION      - used to flag those specification statements which cannot
//                     appear in a union definition
// NOT_IN_MAP        - used to flag those specification statements which cannot
//                     appear in a map definition
