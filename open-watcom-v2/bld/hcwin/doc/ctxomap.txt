THE WINHELP |CTXOMAP INTERNAL FILE
==================================

The |CTXOMAP records the topics which correspond to context numbers defined
in the [MAP] section of a .HPJ file.

The |CTXOMAP format
-------------------

The first word of the file is the number of records in the file.  Immediately
following are the records in order.  Each record is 8 bytes long, where the
first four bytes are the (long int) map number assigned in the [MAP] section,
and the last four bytes are the offset of the corresponding topic.  These
offsets are "Character" offsets; see the section on offsets in topic.txt.

The |CTXOMAP file is present in all .HLP files whether a [MAP] section
if specified or not.  If no [MAP] section was specified, the file will
consist of the standard file header and the word 0x0000 indicating no
records are present.
