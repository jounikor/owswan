THE WINHELP |KWBTREE INTERNAL FILE
==================================

The |KWBTREE file acts as an index to the |KWDATA file, and is arranged as
a b-tree.  See b-tree.txt for a general discussion of b-trees.  This file
along with the |KWDATA and |KWMAP files are used by WinHelp for keyword
searching.

The index pages of the b-tree use zero-terminated ASCII strings as their
key values.  The leaf pages store variable-length records which begin
with zero-terminated ASCII strings (the actual names of the 'keywords'),
and then contain a two-byte 'count' value (the number of topics to which
this keyword refers) and a four-byte plain offset into the |KWDATA file.
The list of topics to which this keyword refer begins in the |KWDATA file
at that offset.

The records in the leaf pages are stored alphabetically by the keyword
strings.
