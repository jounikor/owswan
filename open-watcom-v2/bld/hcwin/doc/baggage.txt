BAGGAGE IN WINHELP FILES
========================

Any 'baggage' files specified in the [BAGGAGE] section of a .HPJ file will
be copied at compile time and stored in the .HLP file as an internal file.
The only change made to the file will be to prepend the standard 9-byte
internal file header (see whifs.txt).  In addition, the baggage file will
be listed in the directory file under the name by which it was specified
in the .HPJ file, minus the path.

That is, if the [BAGGAGE] section of a .HPJ file is as follows:

	[BAGGAGE]
	c:\dos\command.com
	E:\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\WINMINE.EXE
	
Then both command.com and the Win-OS/2 version of MineSweeper will be copied
into the help file (why you'd want them there, I'll never know), and in the
directory file will contain, among other things, entries for "command.com"
and "WINMINE.EXE".  Note that the case of the letters is preserved.
