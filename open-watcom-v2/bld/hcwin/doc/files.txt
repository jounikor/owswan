OVERVIEW OF WINHELP INTERNAL FILES
==================================

The following files are found in some or all Windows Help files:

 |SYSTEM	-- Stores 'global' information such as the title of the
 		   help file, the version of the help compiler used, and
		   the level of compression involved; anything which refers
		   to the entire document goes here.  Present in all help
		   files.  See system.txt.
		   
 |FONT		-- Stores information about fonts used in the help document.
 		   Present in all help files.  See font.txt.
		   
 |Phrases	-- List of phrases which occur frequently in the help text;
 		   used for compression.  Not present in all help files.
		   See phrases.txt.

 |TOPIC		-- The actual help text.  Also contains hotlink references,
 		   formatting flags, and macro references.  Big, complex,
		   ugly, and usually compressed.  Present in all help files.
		   See topic.txt.
		
 |TTLBTREE	-- A b-tree file, storing the titles of all of the topics.
 		   Present in all help files.  See ttlbtree.txt.
		
 |TOMAP		-- A list of pointers to all topics, in order.  A holdover
 		   from Windows 3.0, not used in Windows 3.1 help files
		   (I think).  See tomap.txt.
		 
 |CONTEXT	-- A b-tree file, storing the topic pointers which correspond
 		   to hash values generated by the help compiler and used
		   for hotlinks.  Present in all help files.  See context.txt.
		 
 |CTXOMAP	-- A list of topic numbers and their corresponding topic
 		   pointers.  Present in all help files, but only
		   meaningful when the corresponding *.hpj file has a [MAP]
		   section.  See ctxomap.txt.
		   
 |KWBTREE	-- A b-tree file, storing the location of data in the |KWDATA
 		   file corresponding to individual keywords.  Present in
		   any help file using keywords.  See kwbtree.txt.
	
 |KWMAP		-- A list of the indices of the keywords found at the
 		   beginning of each leaf page in the |KWBTREE file.
		   Used to provide quick access to the tree file; see
		   kwmap.txt.
		   
 |KWDATA	-- A list of topic pointers, in the order of keywords which
 		   refer to them.  Used with WinHelp's Search feature.
		   Present in any help file using keywords.  See kwdata.txt.
		   
 Bitmap files	-- Any bitmap included with a help file is stored as an
 		   internal file under the name |bm0, |bm1, |bm2, and so on.
		   See bmx.txt.

 Baggage files	-- Any file specified in the [Baggage] section of a *.hpj
 		   file is copied verbatim into an internal file of the
		   same name.  See baggage.txt.
