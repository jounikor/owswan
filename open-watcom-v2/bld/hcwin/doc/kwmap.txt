THE WINHELP |KWMAP INTERNAL FILE
================================

The |KWMAP file is a means of speeding up access to the |KWBTREE file if
you are searching for a keyword record by it's index rather than it's string.

The first word of the file is the number of 'map' records in the file.
The map records are listed immediately after each number.  Each record
is 6 bytes long with the following format:

	Bytes		Meaning
	-----------------------
	0-3		The index of the first keyword record on some
			page of the |KWBTREE tree.
	4-5		The index of the corresponding leaf page.
	
E.g., if page 0 is the leftmost leaf page of |KWBTREE, and page 1 is the
next page, then if page 0 has 0x35 keyword records the first 14 bytes of
the |KWMAP file will be:

 20 00         00 00 00 00  00 00   35 00 00 00  01 00    ...
 ^^^^^         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 # of records  First map record     Second map record     ...
 
In other words, the 0th map record begins on the 0th page of |KWBTREE,
the 53rd (0x35) record begins on the 1st page, and so on.

I'm not sure what the |KWMAP file is used for in WinHelp, but it seems to
be a handy file, and it's not hard to construct, so it doesn't worry me too
much.  Any file which uses keyword searching contains a |KWMAP file.
