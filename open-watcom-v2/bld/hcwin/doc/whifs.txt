THE WINHELP INTERNAL FILE SYSTEM
================================

Introduction
------------

Quite simply, a Windows help file consists of a series of consecutive blocks
of data, where each block represents a 'file' that serves some specific
purpose.  (See files.txt for a list of possible 'files'.)  In addition,
a simple 'file system' is included to make it easier to locate specific
files.  The file system has three components:

    -- The WinHelp header structure
    -- Internal file headers
    -- The internal 'directory' file.

The WinHelp Header
------------------

Each *.hlp file starts with a 16-byte header, arranged as follows:

        Bytes           Meaning
        -----------------------
        0-3             Magic Number:   0x00035FF3
        4-7             Offset of the directory within the .hlp file
        8-11            Constant Value: 0xFFFFFFFF
        12-15           File Size in bytes

This header allows WinHelp to find the directory file, and hence all of
the other internal files.

Internal File Headers
---------------------

Each internal file within the *.hlp file starts with a 9-byte header:

        Bytes           Meaning
        -----------------------
        0-3             File Size, including this header
        4-7             File Size, not including this header
        8               Constant Value: 0x00 (0x04 for directory internal file)

Here 'File Size' refers to the size of this internal file in bytes.
Presumably, both sizes are included as a checksum technique.  In many
of the internal files, this header is the only way of determining where
the file ends.

The Directory File
------------------

The directory file is a special file, containing the names and offsets of
all other internal files sorted alphabetically.  The directory is a B-Tree
but unlike the other trees in a WinHelp file the directory
uses 1K pages instead of 2K pages.  Each index node contains page numbers
alternated with zero-terminated filename strings.  Each leaf node contains
zero terminated filename strings followed by their (long int) offsets within
the .hlp file.  Like other internal files, the directory has a 9-byte file
header as described above.

See b_tree.txt for more information about the structure of WinHelp B-trees.
