THE WINHELP |KWDATA INTERNAL FILE
=================================

The |KWDATA file stores the topics to which various keywords 'point'.
The file is just a list of four-byte "Character" offsets into the |TOPIC
file; see topic.txt for a discussion of offsets.  To determine which
offsets correspond to which keywords, the |KWBTREE file is required; see
kwbtree.txt.
