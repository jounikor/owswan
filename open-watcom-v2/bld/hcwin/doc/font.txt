THE WINHELP |FONT INTERNAL FILE
===============================

The |FONT file stores all information about various fonts used in the
the help file.  A |FONT file consists of three parts:  the header, the
font names, and the font descriptors.  A font name refers to a particular
font such as Helvetica or Times Roman.  A font descriptor describes not
only the font, but also the size, font family, colour, and style.

The |FONT Header
----------------

The |FONT header is an 8-byte structure arranged as follows:

	Bytes		Meaning
	-----------------------
	0-1		The number of font names
	2-3		The number of font descriptors
	4-5		The default font descriptor
	6-7		The offset of the descriptor list in this file
	
Font Names
----------

Font names are stored by the same names as they are listed in an *.RTF file,
e.g., "helv" for Helvetica or "tms rmn" for Times Roman.  Each font name is
stored as a zero-terminated ASCII string; however, font names are each given
a 20-byte record in the |FONT file.  Thus, each font name will be followed
by some amount of garbage to pad the string to 20 bytes.  Font names are
stored consecutively in this manner right after the font header.

Font Descriptors
----------------

Font descriptors are stored in a list of 11-byte records in the following
format:

	Bytes		Meaning
	-----------------------
	0		Attribute flags (see below)
	1		Size of the font in HALF points (i.e., pointsize*2)
	2		Font family (see below)
	3		Index of font name in the previous list
	4		Unknown (possibly high byte of previous value)
	5-7		RGB foreground values
	8-10		RGB background values?  Not sure.  Best to keep them
			the same as the foreground values.
			
Possible attribute flags are:
 0x01 -- Bold		0x02 -- Italics		0x04 -- Underline
 0x08 -- Strikeout	0x10 -- Dbl Underline	0x20 -- Small Caps
 
Possible font families are:
 0x01 -- Modern		0x02 -- Roman		0x03 -- Swiss/Tech/Nil
 0x04 -- Script		0x05 -- Decorative
