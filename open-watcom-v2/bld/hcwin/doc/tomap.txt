THE WINHELP |TOMAP INTERNAL FILE
================================

The |TOMAP file is a Windows 3.0 feature supported by the 3.1 WinHelp program
for compatability.  A |TOMAP file should only be present in a help file if
the Flags field in the |SYSTEM header structure is set to 0x000A (see
system.txt).

If the |TOMAP file is present, it will begin with a 64-byte header:

	Bytes		Meaning
	-----------------------
	0-3		Offset of the 'index' or 'contents' topic
	4-63		Reserved, and usually all zeros.
	
Following the header and continuing to the end of the file are a list of
four-byte offsets into the |TOPIC file, which enumerate all of the topic
in the order in which they are stored.  All offsets are "Character" offsets;
see the section on offsets in topic.txt.

In Windows 3.1 help files, the |TOMAP file is not needed due the changed
linked-list structures in the |TOPIC file.
