WINHELP B-TREES
===============

To help the WinHelp program locate help text, many of the WinHelp internal
files are lookup tables stored as modified B-Trees.  The directory file as
well as the |TTLBTREE, |CONTEXT, and |KWBTREE files all have this format.
A B-tree file consists of a B-tree header, followed by one or more
pages of fixed length, each page representing a tree node.  A page is 2KB,
except in the directory where a page is 1KB.

B-Tree Headers
--------------
After the 9-byte file header, a b-tree file will have a header.
There are only four b-tree files in a .HLP file, with different setup for
each type of b-tree file, so this isn't going to present much of a difficulty.

Layout of b-tree header is as follows:

        Bytes           Meaning
        -----------------------
        0-1             0x293B magic
        2-3             bit 0x0002 always 1, bit 0x0400 1 if directory
        4-5             0x0400=1k if directory, 0x0800=2k else, or 4k
        6-21            string[16] describing format of data
                                'L' = long (indexed)
                                'F' = NUL-terminated string (indexed)
                                'i' = NUL-terminated string (indexed)
                                '2' = short
                                '4' = long
                                'z' = NUL-terminated string
                                '!' = long count value, count/8 * record
                                        long filenumber
                                        long TopicOffset
        22-23           Constant Value: 0x0000
        24-25           Number of page splits suffered by this b-tree
        26-27           index # of the root page.
        28-29           Constant Value: 0xFFFF
        30-31           Number of pages in this b-tree
        32-33           Depth of the b-tree
        34-37           Total # of 'leaf' entries in the tree.

Following this header are the pages of the tree, in order.  Links within the
tree are represented by two-byte indices instead of four-bytes file offsets;
thus the first page is always referred to as 0x0000, the second as 0x0001,
and so on.

There are two type of pages:  index pages and leaf pages.  Pages in every
level except the last are (naturally) index pages, while the last level
consists of leaf pages.

Index Pages
-----------

An index page begins with a 4-byte header:
        Bytes           Meaning
        -----------------------
        0-1             Signature Word
        2-3             Number of entries in this page.

The remaining space in the page stores the index data, which consists of
two-byte page indices alternated with key values.  The keys may be fixed
length (as in |TTLBTREE or |CONTEXT) or zero-terminated ASCII strings (as
in the directory and |KWBTREE ).  The page indices 'point' to pages lower
in the tree.

Leaf Pages
----------

A leaf page has a slightly different header than an index page:
        Bytes           Meaning
        -----------------------
        0-1             Signature Word
        2-3             Number of entries in this page
        4-5             Index of the previous leaf page, in order
        6-7             Index of the next leaf page, in order.

The last two words form a linked list of the leaf pages in the tree,
providing another way to traverse the tree's data:  go to the left-most
leaf page and the follow the linked list to read the data in order.  (The
null value for these indices is 0xFFFF ).

The rest of a leaf page stores the data, which consists of fixed or variable
length records packed together.  The nature of the data depends on the tree.
