// Read characters into buffer "buf". At most "len - 1" characters are
// read, and a 0 is added at the end. If "delim" is encountered, it is
// left in the stream and the read is terminated (and the NULLCHAR is
// added).
//
// Used by:
//    get( char *buf, streamsize len, char delim )
//    getline( char *buf, streamsize len, char delim )
//
// NOTE: Borland sets eofbit only. A full buffer just stops reading. If
//       something has been read, set eofbit anyway.
//
//       The proposed standard says to set failbit if the buffer is
//       filled without finding the delimiter (if doing a "getline"), or
//       if a read fails and no characters are extracted. It says
//       nothing about eofbit.
//
//       Currently we set eofbit only if eof occurs on first character
//       read. failbit is set if no characters were read.
//
//       Failbit was being set (prior to Nov15,95) when len-1 characters
//       were read in the buffer. At that time we discerned that no one
//       else was setting failbit in that case, so we stopped doing it.
