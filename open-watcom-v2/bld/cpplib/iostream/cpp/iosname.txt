Filename: iosgnilk.cpp
Declaration:
    __lock *__get_next_ios_lock( void )

Filename: iosfail.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::failure::failure( ios::iostate state )

Filename: iosfacau.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::iostate std::ios::failure::cause() const

Filename: iosinit.cpp
Declaration:
    void std::ios::init( streambuf *sb )
Semantics: Initialize the ios, including a streambuf pointer.
           If the streambuf pointer is NULL, mark the stream as currently invalid.

Filename: iosconde.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::ios()
Semantics: Default constructor, no associated streambuf.


Filename: ioscostf.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::ios( streambuf *sb )
Semantics: Construct an "ios" and initialize it.
           Retain a pointer to the specified streambuf.

Filename: ioscoios.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::ios( const ios &is )
Semantics: Construct an "ios" and initialize it.
           New "ios" gets all fields of "is" except streambuf.


Filename: iosdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::~ios()
Semantics: Destructor

Filename: ioscoeio.cpp
Declaration:
    ios &std::ios::operator = ( const ios &is )
Semantics: Construct an "ios" and initialize it.
           New "ios" gets all fields of "is" except streambuf.


Filename: iosbital.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::fmtflags std::ios::bitalloc()
Semantics: Find an unused bit in "__format_flags".
           Note that there is only one "__last_format_flag" value for all
	   streams.


Filename: iossetst.cpp
Declaration:
	void std::ios::setstate( ios::iostate on_bits ) 
Sematntics: Set __error_state and throw an exception, if enabled.


Filename: iosxallo.cpp
Declaration:
    int std::ios::xalloc()
Semantics: Find an unused (long) or (void *) for the user to use.
           Return a number that can be used to find a reference to it
           (via iword or pword).
           Presumably, such a reference must remain valid forever, so
           allocating a new value must not move old values.


Filename: iosiword.cpp
Declaration:
    long &std::ios::iword( int index )
Semantics: Find the (long) referred to by "index".
           Assumes that "index" was returned by "xalloc".


Filename: iospword.cpp
Declaration:
    void *&std::ios::pword( int index )
Semantics: Find the (void *) referred to by "index".
           Assumes that "index" was returned by "xalloc".


Filename: iosclear.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::iostate std::ios::clear( ios::iostate state )
Semantics: Set __error_state to state

Filename: iosexcep.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ios::iostate std::ios::exceptions( ios::iostate enable )
Semantics: Set __enabled_exceptions
