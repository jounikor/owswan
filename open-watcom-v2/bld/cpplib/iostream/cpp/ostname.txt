******************************* OSTREAM **************************************

Filename: ostconde.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream::ostream()
Semantics: Protected constructor creates an ostream without other information.


Filename: ostconsf.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream::ostream( streambuf *sb ) : ios( sb )
Semantics: Constructor creates an ostream using the specified streambuf.
           The "ios" portion of the object has already been initialized.


Filename: ostcoost.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream::ostream( ostream const &ostrm )
Semantics: Constructor creates an ostream using the ostrm streambuf.


Filename: ostcoesf.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator = ( streambuf *sb )
Semantics: *this is an ostream that has been initialized, and may or may not
           have a streambuf associated with it.
           Associate the streambuf "sb" with the stream.


Filename: ostcoeos.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator = ( ostream const &ostrm )
Semantics: *this is an ostream that has been initialized, and may or may not
           have a streambuf associated with it.
           Associate the streambuf found in "ostrm" with the stream.


Filename: ostdestr.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream::~ostream()
Semantics: Destructor.


Filename: ostopfx.cpp
Declaration: 
    int std::ostream::opfx()
Semantics: Prefix to all ostream activities.
           Return a 0 (fail) if an error state is set.


Filename: ostosfx.cpp
Declaration: 
    void std::ostream::osfx()


Filename: ostincha.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator << ( char c )
Semantics: Write a single character to the stream.


Filename: ostadpre.cpp
Declaration: 
    void __AddPrefix( char iszero, char *buffer, int &size, int base,
    		      long format_flags )
Semantics: Add a prefix to an output integer representing the base used.
           Add 0 for octal numbers, except for zero.
           Add 0x or 0X for hex numbers.
           Add nothing for decimal numbers.


Filename: ostinslo.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator << ( signed long i )
Semantics: Write a signed long integer to the stream.


Filename: ostinulo.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator << ( unsigned long i )
Semantics: Write an unsigned long integer to the stream.
           A signed long integer displayed in base 8 or base 16 also uses
           this routine.


Filename: ostincch.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator << ( char const *s )


Filename: ostinptr.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator << ( void *p )
Semantics: Write the value of a pointer (the address contained in the pointer).


Filename: ostinstf.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator << ( streambuf *sb )
Semantics: Read all characters from the streambuf and write them to the ostream.


Filename: ostput.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::put( char c )
Semantics: Write a single character to the ostream.


Filename: ostwrite.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::write( char const *buf, int len )
Semantics: Write a sequence of characters to the ostream.


Filename: ostflush.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::flush()
Semantics: Flush the ostream.


Filename: ostinomn.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator << ( ostream &(*f)( ostream & ) )
Semantics: Handles things like cout << endl where "endl" is a function taking
	   a stream reference and returning the same. Essentially, this just does
	   an indirect call to the function.


Filename: ostiniom.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::operator << ( ios &(*f)( ios & ) )
Semantics: Handles things like cout << endl where "endl" is a function taking
	   an ios reference and returning the same. Essentially, this just
	   does an indirect call to the function.


Filename: ostspstp.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::seekp( streampos pos )


Filename: ostspsto.cpp
Declaration: 
    std::ostream &std::ostream::seekp( streamoff offset, ios::seekdir dir )


Filename: osttellp.cpp
Declaration: 
    streampos std::ostream::tellp()
