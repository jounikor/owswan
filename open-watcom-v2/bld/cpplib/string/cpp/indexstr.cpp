//  Modified    By              Reason
//  ========    ==              ======
//  92/01/09    Steve McDowell  Initial simple implementation using C library
//                              string functions wherever possible.
//  92/01/20    ...             Added checking for invalid Strings, including
//                              adding the ! operator, the == and !=
//                              operators with integer arguments, and the
//                              "valid" member and friend functions.
//  92/03/11    ...             Re-implemented using StringReps (reference
//                              counts, offset and length).
//  92/10/08    Greg Bentz      Cleanup.
//  93/08/31    Greg Bentz      - make extractor skip whitespace if
//                                ios::skipws is set
//                              - correct offset computation in substring
//  93/10/07    Greg Bentz      - alloc_mult_size() not setting new value right
//  93/10/19    Raymond Tang    split into separate files
//  94/04/06    Greg Bentz      combine header files
//  94/04/19    Greg Bentz      Kevin H. found sneaky bug
//  94/04/22    Kevin Hui       Added range check
