:: "The Alpha NT version (the only one we have) has 32-bit long ints and
:: 64-bit long long ints. Essentially the system behaves just like a
:: 32-bit machine (pointers are only 32-bit, too), except long longs fit
:: in registers. The PPC port was only targeted for 32-bit PPC systems,
:: it's much like a 386."

::           char | short | int | long | long long
::  16 bit : 8      16      16    32     64        All 16 bit targets
::  32 bit : 8      16      32    32     64        386, AXP, PPC, MIPS

:: Some of these types are also defined in sys/types.h. However, protection
:: with the _EXACT_WIDTH_INTS is not needed in cstdint because the types are
:: declared in namespace std (and thus can't conflict with the global types
:: in sys/types.h anyway). In fact, if both sys/types.h and cstdint are
:: included we want the exact width integer types declared in both namespaces.
