:: POSIX, ISO C/C++ clock_t typedef declaration
::
:: Open Watcom only defines clock_t in time.h/ctime. However, the legacy
:: OW declaration was protected by an inclusion guard that defined the
:: symbol _CLOCK_T_DEFINED. This was done for compatibility with MS
:: Visual C. When I upgraded time.mh to support the generation of ctime,
:: I created this file. This complexity is technically unnecessary for
:: Open Watcom, but this is the correct way to handle types defined with
:: inclusion guards. For consistency with size_t, time_t, and other similar
:: types, I felt it appropriate to configure clock_t in this way as well.
