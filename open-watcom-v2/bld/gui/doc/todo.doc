ToDo
====

General
-------

- +allow top level menus on GUI_POPUP windows
- +add GUIDrawText that takes a point not row and offset
- +need to give tab key to app from edit control
- +multiple selection list boxes
- *ctrl-tab for next window in MDI, etc
- *system menus with MDI need work
- *accelerators for system menus
- *give character accel to child menu not top level
- PM
- GUI_CONTROL_NOW_ACTIVE for those that windows supports
- status window sections
- allow window to be stuck in front of another window
- make gui_rect two points
- set up error codes
- modal and non-modal dialog boxes

UI-based
--------

- +what is GUIWndUpdate used for? get rid of it? Used by DB?
- *when app gains scroll bar through GUISetScrollRange, redraw whole frame
- *bug in sample : make hidden window visible, click on it, doesn't redraw
- *make sure mouse cursor shows whenever it should
- *disable main menu when doing resize and move
- *command dialog with flip under character mapping doesn't remap correctly - John?
- *keyboard accelerators for check boxes and radio buttons
- *look at splitpath in guifdlg
- *in OS/2 DOS window, don't use graphical stuff.  Change when message received. - John will use switch
- *GUISelectAll for edit controls, edit controls with selection, like Windows
- *optimize drawing when burried windows are painted in (don't paint covered)
- *get rid of alt tap (Brian) - WIN-OS2 doesn't
- *don't do char mapping in 50 or 43 line mode or create mapped characters
  (debugger switch ?)
- let windows go off of visible screen (up to me)
- process EV_BACKGROUND_RESIZE event
- make QNX work properly
- hint text for floating toolbar 
- paint problem when creating dialog box with background uncovered under menu
- scrolling of controls in windows
- get rid of 'no bright backgrounds' restriction
- allow app to map colours
- fix bug that, on windows, listbox, etc. draw one character too wide (will fix itself if I go to UI framed windows)
- implement GUIDisplayMessage with proper icons
- multiline edit fields
- ^more mouse cursor in DOS (hourglass, resize on corners)
- ^more mapped characters for apps and my dialog boxes (stop sign, etc)


Windows
-------

- +user rwrelockcheck linker option and get rid of bugs
- +make enablemenu etc work for popups
- *hint text for popups in NT
- *give ctrl-esc to windows
- *take a good look at extra pixel (between maximized and non-max MDI window)
- *fix bug where a partial bottom line gets drawn
- *check floating toolbar bitmap placement algorithm
- *make floating popup have correct initial selection
- think about making resolution of scroll range sent to windows configureable
- group box on a window problem
- fix midsim code so that it doesn't need closebmp
- ^rewrite of floating popup code for debugger ? -- try ShowOwnedPopups


Future Considerations
---------------------

- windows that attach/detach from parents
- push pins
- get and set cursor pos if ever needed

Think About
-----------

- is library it general enough to have child windows with child windows
- consider taking out ability to define entire scale, just assume 0,0 and ask for width/height


* - for debugger
^ - in my dreams
+ - for WCLASS
