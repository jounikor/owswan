 *
 *      Parameters
 *              sruname - this should point to the full path name of the
 *                        .sru file to process. sruname must be non-empty
 *                        and non-NULL.
 *              parentname - if this user object inherits from another this
 *                        parameter should point to the name of the parent
 *                        object.  If this object does not inherit from

 *                      or warnings are generated during processing then
 *                      on exit *info will point to a WatIDEErrInfo structure

 *                      built.  This path should be the same as the path
 *                      specified when WatIDE_RunWig was called to generate

 *      Notes
 *              PB should ensure that code for separate DLL's is kept in
