`Generic Adventure 551' is a cleaned up and enhanced version of the 
old classic text game `Adventure'. It is based on a version close to the
seriously non-portable (and buggy) version for Primes posted last spring. I 
have done a fair job of cleaning it up, portabilizing it, and debugging, but
it is still Fortran spaghetti. For you with no Fortran compilers, this is the 
excuse you need to get "f2c" working!!! It has worked on the IBM-PC, VMS, the 
MIPS 120, the IBM RISCstation 600, the VAX/Ultrix, and a Prime. It will
however expose toy Fortran compilers as just that - toys. I would like to 
thank Larry Estep for finding some hidden bugs.

For those that have not experienced this, the very first text adventure game,
it is a romp through the darkest reaches of Colossal Cave in search of
riches. You will find evocative descriptions of the darker, more mysterious
places of the earth, and severely test your abilities to map the
contortions of the cave. You will find some hard - and some deceptively
easy - puzzles to solve.
