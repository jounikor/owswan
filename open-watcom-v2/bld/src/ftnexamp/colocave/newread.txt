Original Colossal Cave adventure, with extensions
making it a 551 points version.

I found this source (Adventure 6) at 
http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/index.html

It seems to carry no copyright or other restrictions 
anywhere, It could be used as a Fortran source sample
program or as a sanity test source after compiler rebuild.

I have replaced the original makefile dowloaded form site above.
I have changed .f extensions to .for
I have changed all file names to lower case only.
