* Description:  Declares functions used to check the heap.
*               Does not require special compilation switches or provide
*               endless undocumented options.
*               These are the primary functions:
*                   end_heapcheck()
*                   display_heap()
*                   start_heapcheck()
*               and this is the auxiliary function:
*                   null_buffer()

/* How to Use These Functions.
 *
 * The three primary functions each have a single parameter, a character string.
 * This string will be displayed at the start of the heap dump. It is not used
 * in any other way. In particular, it is not used to associate calls to
 * end_heapcheck() with calls to start_heapcheck().
 *
 * display_heap() simply produces a heap dump. No attempt to determine if the
 * heap has changed from the last heap dump is made.
 *
 * Each invocation of start_heapcheck() preserves information about the last
 * block on the heap. Only one set of this information exists: each invocation
 * of start_heapcheck() will overwrite any prior values.
 *
 * Each invocation of end_heapcheck() compares the information describing the
 * last block on the heap with the saved information. If it is different, then
 * a message to that effect will appear after the heap dump. The saved information
 * is not changed.
 *
 * Because only one set of saved information exists, start_heapcheck() and
 * end_heapcheck() pairs will not work properly if they overlap or are nested.
 *
 * The function start_heapcheck() should be used to establish a starting
 * condition for the heap. Because the run-time uses the heap, this will usually
 * not be an empty heap even at the start of the main() function. This function
 * can be placed anywhere in the code; the location should be chosen to show the
 * heap before the heap actions to be examined take place.
 *
 * The function end_heapcheck() should be used to determine whether or not there
 * has been a net change in the heap since the start_heapcheck() was invoked. The
 * theory here is that, if there is no net change, then anything allocated on the
 * heap in the intermediate code has also been freed. A program showing no net
 * change from the start of main() to the end of main() is not leaking memory.
 *
 * The function display_heap() should be used at any point in the program where
 * the state of the heap needs to be determined.
 *
 * Taken together, these functions can:
 *      identify regions in a program over which the heap is the same at the end
 *          as it is at the start.
 *      identify regions in a program over which the heap is not the same at the
 *          end as it is at the start.
 *      map heap usage at any number of points in the program.
 *
 * The auxiliary function null_buffer() compensates for a minor quirk observed in
 * the Open Watcom runtime: when a file cannot be found, so that a NULL pointer is
 * returned as the value of FILE *, a buffer is allocated which cannot be
 * deallocated by the user program. In particular, fclose(), although documented to
 * close any automatically-allocated buffer associated with the FILE *, will not
 * close it when the value of the FiLE * is a NULL pointer. Although the run-time
 * allocates several buffers before main() starts, this is not one of them.
 * null_buffer() attempts to open a file (".") that is guaranteed not to exist,
 * thus causing the buffer to be allocated. If called before the first call to
 * start_heapcheck(), it ensures that this unfreeable buffer is allocated before
 * the testing begins.
