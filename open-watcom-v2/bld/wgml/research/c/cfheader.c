/*  Function parse_header().
 *  Determine if the current position of the input stream points to the
 *  start of a valid .COP file and, if it does, advance the stream to the
 *  first byte following the header.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *      in_file points the input stream.
 *      type points to a char intended to hold the file type byte.
 *
 *  Modified
 *      type is set to the file type byte if SUCCESS is returned.
 *      type is either the same as on entry or is set to EOF if FAILURE
 *          is returned (depending on where the return occurs).
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      FAILURE if in_file does not point to the start of a valid .COP
 *          file header.
 *      FAILURE on any file error or on EOF, since a valid .COP file has
 *          data after the header.
 *      SUCCESS otherwise.
