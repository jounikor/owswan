* Description: implement .pa (page)  script control word
*                        only used options are implemented
*                        i.e.   ODD EVEN and NOSTART per default
*               not implemented are the other options
*
*                        .cp (conditional page) script control word
*                        only used options are implemented
*                        i.e. .cp numbervalue
