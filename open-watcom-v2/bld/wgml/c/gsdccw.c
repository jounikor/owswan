/*    default action is  to process leading blanks as  Required Blanks or  */
/*    En Spaces in the current font.  Any printable character may also be  */

/*    blank (hex 40).    The &SYSMCS Set  Symbol returns the  current MCS  */

/*    reference entry" with the .IX control word, causes that index entry  */
/*    to appear at the beginning of the list of reference entries.   This  */
/*    character does not get added to  the reference entry.   The default  */
/*    and initial primary index character is an asterisk (*).   The "OFF"  */
/*    value is  a blank.    The &SYSPIX  Set Symbol  returns the  current  */
/*    primary index character.                                             */
/* PS  (Page  Symbol):  defines the character  that is to be  replaced by  */
/*    the current  page number in title  control words.   It may  also be  */
/*    used  in Set  Symbol assignments.    The default  and initial  page  */
/*    symbol character is the percent (%).    The "OFF" value is a blank.  */
/*    The &SYSPS Set Symbol returns the current page symbol character.     */
/* PUNC  (Spell Punctuation):   define characters that are  to be consid-  */
/*    ered as part of a word if they  occur in the middle of a word,  but  */
/*    are to be ignored  if they occur at the end.    The initial default  */
/*    PUNC character is the single quote.  See .DC WORD also.              */
/* RB  (Required Blank):  defines a character that  is to be treated as a  */
/*    required blank (will appear as a blank  on output,  but will not be  */
/*    recognized as an interword blank).  This is useful for keeping text  */
/*    together on one line.  The initial and default value for a required  */
/*    blank is  hex 00.   The "OFF"  value is  a blank.   The  &SYSRB Set  */
/*    Symbol returns the current required blank character.                 */
/* STOP  (full-stop punctuation):  defines the characters that are recog-  */
/*    nized as "full stops"  when they occur at the end  of an input text  */
/*    line.  Two intervening blanks will be placed after such characters,  */
/*    before the next word on the  output line.   The initial and default  */
/*    list of stop characters are the period (.), question (?),  exclama-  */
/*    tion (!)   and colon (:).   When  SCRIPT is invoked with  the PHOTO  */
/*    option, "OFF" is default.                                            */
/* SUB (SUBscript  characters):  defines  the characters  that are  to be  */
/*    used for  the Subscript  Function (&s').    Character operands  are  */
/*    specified in  pairs,  with  the first  specifying the  normal input  */
/*    character  and the  second specifying  the output  character to  be  */
/*    generated when  the input character is  used in the operand  of the  */
/*    Subscript Function.   The initial  and default Subscript characters  */
/*    are  defined in  the  ALA print  character  assignments.   See  the  */
/*    Appendix on "Print  Trains" for those character  assignments.   The  */
/*    "OFF" operand translates all Subscript Function characters to them-  */
/*    selves.                                                              */
/* SUP  (SUPerscript characters):   defines character  pairs ("from"  and  */
/*    "to") to be used with the Superscript Function (&S').   The default  */
/*    character assignments are those of the TN character assignments.     */
/* TB  (TaB  character):  defines a character  that will be treated  as a  */
/*    tab character in input text and control words.  The initial default  */
/*    value and the "OFF" value is hex 05, the real tab character,  which  */
/*    is always recognized  as a tab character even when  .DC TB has been  */
/*    used to define another.   The &SYSTB Set Symbol returns the current  */
/*    user-defined tab character, or hex 05 if none has been defined.      */
/* TI  (Translate on Input):  defines an escape character that causes the  */
/*    character immediately  following it to  be translated  according to  */
/*    the .TI translate table currently  in effect.   The initial default  */
/*    value  and the  "OFF" value  is a  blank.   The  &SYSTI Set  Symbol  */
/*    returns the current escape character.                                */
/* WORD   (Spell Word  Delimiters):   define  characters that  are  never  */
/*    considered as part of a word.  By default, only the alphabetics are  */
/*    valid  characters and  everything else  will terminate  a word  for  */
/*    purposes of Spelling Verification.  The single quote (see .DC PUNC)  */
/*    is valid within a word.   Any given character may be either a Spell  */
/*    Punctuation character or a Spell Word Delimiter character,  but not  */
/*    both at the same time.                                               */
/* XTEXT  (Transparent Text):   defines the character that  delimits text  */
/*    that is transparent for purposes of  justifying lines when it imme-  */
/*    diately follows the escape character.    Such transparent text will  */
/*    follow <escape><xtext> and is terminated on the right by an <xtext>  */
/*    character  or the  end of  the input  line.   Any  text except  the  */
/*    <xtext> character itself,  including  other escapes and backspaces,  */
/*    may appear between the delimiters.    The initial default value and  */
/*    the "OFF" value is a blank.    The &SYSXTEXT Set Symbol returns the  */
/*    current transparent text character.                                  */
