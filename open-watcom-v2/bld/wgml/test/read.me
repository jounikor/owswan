The gml files in this directory are a testbed used to try out some functionality.
They are not ment to produce good looking output.

In the future they may serve for producing comparison files between wgml 4.0 and the new WGML.

tsys06.gml      lists all system variables of form SYSx, x = 1 to 6 letters
                runtime is very long
sysvar.gml      result of tsys06.gml run(s)
cwcofoju.gml    testfile for .co .fo .ju
tcwli.gml       testfile for .li
tcwmacro.gml    testfile for macro parms and parmcount bug
tcwpe.gml       testfile for .pe
tcwti.gml       testfile for .ti
tdocx.gml       testfile for section changes
terrs.gml       error tests; intended to eventually trip all possible error
                messages related to control word and tag parsing
thpxsf.gml      testfile for :HPx and :SF tags
thpxsf2.inc     testfile for :HPx and :SF tags
tindex.gml      testfile for .ix :Ix :IHx :IREF :INDEX tags
tlayfull.gml    testfile for :layout tags (only for new wgml)
tlayout.gml     testfile for :layout tags
tlayno.gml      testfile short without :layout tags
tnote.gml       testfile for :note tag
tpacp.gml       testfile for .pa .cp
trefid.gml      testfile for :Hx :HDREF
tsimpin.inc     included from tsimp00.gml, tsimp01.gml, ... for testing different layouts
tsimpNN.gml     masterfile(s) for different layouts  NN = 00 to ??
tsimpNNi.inc    Layout specification for tsimpNN.gml
ts.inc          .ty for several variables (included from other files)
tstpchar.gml    testfile for stop chars (.?!:)
txl.gml         testfile for :ol, :sl, :ul and other list tags
txl2.inc        testfile for :ol, :sl, :ul and other list tags
txl3.inc        testfile for :ol, :sl, :ul and other list tags
txmp.gml        testfile for :xmp and list tags

This file is intended to be used to compare horizontal positioning in wgml 4.0
and the new WGML:

ocdoc1.gml      based on outcheck output, except for reduced sub/sup tests

This file is intended to show what the new WGML can do which wgml 4.0 can not:

ocdoc2.gml      based on outcheck output, including the full sub/sup tests

These files were developed for testing TB and contain a lot of text, macros, and symbols from the OW Documents. They may be useful in tracking down some residual problems, and should provide a good test for BX when BX is implemented:

tabtest.gml     the test file
ttmacs.gml      the macros used in tabtest.gml
ttsyms.gml      the symbols used in tabtest.gml
