// Visit code is used to get around a bug in the floodfill algorithm.
// If filling with a non-solid pattern, it is not always possible to
// tell if an area has already been filled, leading to infinite loops.
// For WPAINT, (which uses worldm.lib or worldl.lib) the visit routines
// keep track of what points we have visited.


short _flood_is_visited( short x, short y )

// Stub version of _flood_is_visited

    x = x;
