Building libraries:
    1) cd to the misc directory of your choice:
        os2386          -- OS/2 2.x
        nt386           -- Windows NT on x86
        dosos2          -- DOS and OS/2 1.x bound exe's
        dos             -- DOS-only exe's
    2) type wmake


Steps for building all the programs at once:

    1) cd to the systems directory of your choice:
        os2386          -- OS/2 2.x
        nt386           -- Windows NT on x86
        dosos2          -- DOS and OS/2 1.x bound exe's
        dos             -- DOS-only exe's
    2) type wmake


Steps for building a particular program

    1) cd to the src directory that contains the program
    2) If you wish to build for a specific target, type
            wmake targos=<targname>
       where <targname> is one of os2386, nt386, dosos2, or dos.
       If you do not specify the targos, then the makefiles try to
       guess... if you're building under
                OS/2            the default is targos=os2386
                DOS             the default is targos=dosos2
                NT              the default is targos=nt386


Steps for adding a new program:

    1) Make a directory in the src directory that has the same name
        as the program.
    2) Create a makefile in this directory that is similar to the
        makefile for one of the other programs.  The makefile must
        define these two macros:

            name        -- must be the same as the directory and program name
            objs        -- space delimited list of object file names

        it can also define:

            cflags      -- appended to flags specified automatically

        Then the makefile should !include $(posix_dir)\mif\makeone.mif.
    3) Add the program name to mif\commands.mif


Steps for adding a new operating system:

    1) grep for targos in the mif subdirectory, it should be obvious what
        needs to be changed.
    2) create a directory with an appropriate name
    3) copy and modify the makefile from one of the os2v2, dos, dosos2,
        or nt directories.



Notes about the programs:

    The programs are either compiled compact model (16-bit) or flat
    model (32-bit).  The current makeall structure doesn't support
    mixed model object files in the same directory...
