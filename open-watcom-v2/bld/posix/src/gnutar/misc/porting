The Makefile should be edited to comment out all the undesired
versions, and create the following configuration lines for the system
you are compiling it on:

DEFS = the proper #define's to conditionally compile for
your system.
LIBS = the system libraries and/or object modules to link
with the program.
LINTFLAGS = a good strong way to invoke 'lint' on your system.
DEF_AR_FILE = the name of the default archive file on your system.
It should be enclosed in quoted quotes, e.g. \"/dev/foo\" .
DEFBLOCKING = the default blocking factor on your system.

A copy of "getopt", the standard argument parser, is required.  It's in
libc on Missed'em V systems and 4.3BSD; on most other systems, you'll
need a copy of a public domain getopt, available through mod.sources
or the AT&T Toolchest if you can't find it elsewhere.

A copy of the Berkeley directory access routines is also required.
These are in libc and <sys/dir.h> on Berkeley systems.  A public domain
version is available through mod.sources.  There is an #include you
have to change in create.c for this, to set the name of the include
file you have.  Some systems have the include file in <sys/ndir.h>.
You'll have to find it on your system, or get the public domain one
and place it somewhere.

Grep for FIXME to find places that aren't finished or which have
portability problems.  Also see the file TODO.
