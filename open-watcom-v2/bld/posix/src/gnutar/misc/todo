@(#) TODO 1.6 86/10/29

Install new mkdir from the net for non-Berkeley systems.

Look at SUID, SGID; look at -p and -m options.  (test them).

Handle owner/group on extraction.

creation of links and symlinks doesn't follow the -k (f_keep) guidelines;
if the file already exists, it is not replaced, even though no -k.

Check stderr and stdout for errors after writing, and quit if so.

Compression option to automatically pipe thru compress (both input&output).
(Need a 3rd process to reblock compress's output for output case, and when
reading from tape drives.)

Preliminary design of Multifile option to handle EOFs on input and output.
Multifile can just write EOF when it hits end of archive, and ask for
archive to be changed.  Start off 2nd archive medium with odd header
block, duplicating original, but with offset to start of data spec'd.
Reading such a header causes tar non-'M' to complain while extracting
(but to seek there and do it anyway!)  Big win -- this works on
cartridge tapes, should work on floppies, might work on magtape.
It would encourage the *&%#$ systems programmers to fix their drivers, too!

Profile it and see where the time, call counts, etc are going.

Test reading compressed tapes with odd blocksizes.
(real tape drives, that is...)
(may need buffer proc no matter what.)

Fix directory timestamps after inserting files into them.  Wait til next
file that's not in the directory.  Need a stack of them.

Add option to delete N matching(?) chars from the front of a file to
be extracted/listed.  Great for reading tapes written with names starting
from "/"...

Option to seek the input file (in skip_file) rather than reading
and tossing it?  (Could just jump in buffer if stuff is in core.)
Could misalign archive reads versus filesys and slow it down, who knows?

Add -C option for creating from odd directories a la 4.2BSD?

Break out odd bits of code into separate support modules.

Add the r, u, X, l, F, C, and digit options of Unix tar.
