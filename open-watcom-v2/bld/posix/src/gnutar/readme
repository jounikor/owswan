The tar software is public domain source from the early days of GNU.  It
was not all that great, and has many warnings with our compiler.  I made
the changes to make it work (fixed clear bugs), eliminated the possibility
of doing direct sector disk I/O, and changed the code slightly to modify
the file names being written so that there are no collisions.
