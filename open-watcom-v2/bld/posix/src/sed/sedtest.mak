Usage: sed [-g] [-n] script file ...
       sed [-g] [-n] -e script ... -f script_file ... file ...

  -g: global substitute             -n: no default copy,
  script: append to commands,       script_file: append contents to commands
  file: a text file - lines of upto 8K bytes, \n not needed on last line
        default is to read from standard input

General command format:
    [addr1][,addr2] [!]function [arguments]
    [addr1][,addr2] [!]s/[RE]/replace/[p|P][g][w file]

Command list:
    a: append,      b: branch,    c: change,   d/D: delete,
    g/G: get,       h/H: hold,    i: insert,   l: list,
    n/N: next,      p/P: print,   q: quit,     r: read,
    s: substitute,  t/T: test,    w/W: write,  x: xchange,
    y: translate,   :label,       =: number,   {}: grouping

Regular expression elements:
    \n, and \t: newline, and tab
    ^: line begin,             $$: line end,
    [a-z$$0-9]: class,          [^a-z$$]: inverse-class,
    .: one character,          *: 0 or more repeats,
    +: one or more repeats,    \{n,m\} n to m repeats,
    \(..\): subexpression,     \1..\9: matched subexpression,

Substitution patterns:
    \n,\t: newline and tab
    &: match pattern,          \1..\9: matched subexpression
