                    WATCOM  .RES  File Manipulation


The files in this project allow mainipulation of the WATCOM  .RES  format files
and Microsoft .RES format files, both on disk and in memory.

To use this project include the file WRESALL.H and link the libray WRES?.LIB
where ? is the model you are using.

The layout of a WATCOM .RES file can be found in the file  filefmt.h.

There are three layers to this project. Layer 0 is the low level I/O and memory
allocation routines. By defualt these will be the ISO C I/O routines and
malloc/free. An application may replaces these routines with its own provided
the routines supplied take the same parameters and return the same values as
the defaults. Also the routines must perform trasparently as to their functions.
See the setrtns.h and wresrtns.c files for the means of replacing these
instuctions.

Layer 1 is the record level I/O routines. It provides routines to read and write 
the various structures contained in a .RES file. This layer does no memory 
allocation except to store the name of a resource on calls that read a WResID in
and need a name. Use the WResIDFreeName function to release this memory.

Layer 2 is the directory management routines. This layer allows you to read and
write a complete directory and to manage that directory in memory. It does
memory allocation and deallocation as required to acomplish this.
