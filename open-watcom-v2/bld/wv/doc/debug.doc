--- Concepts

    The debugger is a context sensitive environment.  When an
    operation is selected from a right mouse (or Action) menu its action
    depends on the active window and possibly the selected item or
    the item under the cursor.  The following right mouse
    operations recurr throughout the debugger and are central to
    it's operation.  They will appear in the right mouse menu of
    any window where the operation might make sense.

    
    *** Inspect

	Inspects the selcted item in a window.  Typing information
	to determine how to inspect the item.  If it is a
	variable, it's displayed in a variable window.  If it's a
	function, the Source window will be positioned to the
	starting line of the function.  If it's a hex address,
	memory is displayed starting at that address.

    *** Modify

        Changes the item under the cursor.  You will be prompted for
	a new value.

    *** New

        Add a new item to the window.  eg: add a new break point in the
	break point window.

    *** Delete

        Delete the selected item from the window.  eg: delete a hotkey definition.

    *** Source

        Show the source code associated with the selected item.

    *** Modules

        Show a list of modules associated with the selected item.

    *** Functions

        Show the list of functions associated with the selected item (image)
	or window (Source/Assembly).

    *** Assembly

        Show the assembly code associated with the selected item.

    *** Watch

        Add the selected item to the watches window.

    *** Search

        Search a window for a specified string.

    *** Break

	Sets a break point based on the selcted item.  Typing information
	to determine what kind of break to set.  If it is a
	variable, it's break on write.  If it's a
	function, it's break on execute.

    *** Home

    	Move the window to the currently executing location.

    *** Address

        Move the window to show code associated with an Address.  You
	are prompted for an address expression.

    *** Raw Memory

        Show the memory where a variable resides.

    *** Pointer Memory

        Show the memory referenced by a pointer variable.

    *** Globals

        Show a list of global variables.

    *** Unwind/Rewind

        Position the state of the debugger up/down the call stack.

    *** Undo/Redo

        The debugger keeps a history of all interactions that modify the
	state of the program being debugged.  Undo/Redo lets you browse
	through this history.

    *** Replay

        The debugger keeps a history of all interactions that might
	affect program execution.  Replay will let you restart your
	debugging session and replay it to any point.

    *** Goto

        Let the application program run util the selected code is reached.

--- Preparing a Program to be Debugged

    *** Compiling an application for debugging
    *** d1, d1+, d2, etc..
    *** Linking an application for debugging
    *** debug all, debug lines, debug locals etc...
    *** creating a separate symbol file
    
--- Quick tutorial

    *** primary purpose is to show the look and feel of the debugger
    *** secondary purpose is to ensure that everything is set up correctly
    *** quick simple character mode program that should work in every environment
	    -------------------
	    Start up debugger
	    Step into
	    Look at elements in a structure
	    set a breakpoint
	    undo
	    inspect/modify variable
	    view/unwind call stack
	    quit
	    -------------------
    
--- Starting up the Debugger
    
    *** Environment setup to run debugger
	    path, libpath
	    VxDs, DLLs that need to be loaded
