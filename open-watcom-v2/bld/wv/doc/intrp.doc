Interrupting a running program
------------------------------

Windows.

	Type CTRL-ALT-F.  Windows must be running in enhanced mode
	and the device WDEBUG.386 must be installed the [386Enh]
	section of SYSTEM.INI for this to work.  It will not work
	under Win-OS/2.

DOS.

	Hit the Print Screen key.  This will work if the program
	is stuck in a loop.  If it has misbehaved in some other
	way, the key sequence may have no effect since a
	misbehaved application may overwrite code and/or data of
	the debugger or operating system.

OS/2.
	Switch focus to the debugger screen and type CTRL-BREAK.
	If you type CTRL-BREAK when the application has focus, you
	will terminate the task being debugged rather than
	interrupting it.

NetWare.

	On the NetWare file server console, type ALT-ESCAPE while
	holding down both shift keys.  This may cause the system
	debugger to become active instead of $(dbg).

PenPoint

	On the PenPoint machine, type the pause key twice within
	one second.

NT
	Switch focus to the application's screen and type CTRL-BREAK.

QNX
	Switch focus to the debugger console and type CTRL-BREAK.
	Alternatively you may send any unhandled signal to the
	application being debugged.  Consult your QNX system documentation
	for details.
