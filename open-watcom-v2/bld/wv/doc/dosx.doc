	Some Theory On How Debugging DOS Extended Programs Works
==============================================================================

The remote servers are real mode programs. Most DOS-extenders provide a 
debugging interface, but only from protected mode. To solve this problem, 
and to allow a single debugger executable to handle multiple DOS-extenders 
and other good stuff, the debugger implements debugging of DOS-extended 
applications as a very wierd sort of remote link. See the LINK.DOC file in 
this directory for an explanation of the 6 functions that need to be written 
for a remote link. For DOS-extended trap files, these 6 functions are 
implemented in the file "LCL\DOS\DOSX\C\DOSXLINK.C". That's the generic code.
There are a number of extender specific functions that DOSXLINK.C needs. 
Basically DOSXLINK.C spawns the DOS-extender and sets up a low memory buffer 
where requests and results are passed through. Not all trap file requests are 
passed up to the protected mode "remote server" (these are the ???HELP.EX? 
files). For example, all the DOS file I/O requests are handled directly by the
PLS.TRP, ADS.TRP, or RSI.TRP files. This code is in the 
"LCL\DOS\DOSX\C\DOSXREMO.C" file. As a matter of fact, the DOSXREMO.C code 
does not call the RemoteLink function to spawn the DOS-extender until it gets 
a program load request from the debugger. This is to make memory management 
in the debugger a little easier. The generic DOS-extender remote server code 
that catches the request being passed up by DOSXREMO.C is in the file 
"LCL\DOS\DOSX\C\DOSXSERV.C".
