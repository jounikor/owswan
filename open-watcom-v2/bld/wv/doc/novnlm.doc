Novell NLM's may only be debugged remotely.  You must
use either the serial, parallel or Novell SPX link.
There are 6 NLM's distributed with WATCOM C.  The following table
describes their use:

		NetWare 3.11/3.12	NetWare 4.01

Serial		serserv3.nlm		serserv4.nlm
Parallel	parserv3.nlm		parserv4.nlm
SPX		novserv3.nlm		novserv4.nlm

To start remote debugging you load the appropriate NLM on the NetWare
file server. The debugger is then loaded as in any remote debugging
session. See the section entitled "remote debugging" for parameter
details. See the appendix entitled "Wiring for remote debugging" for
Parallel/Serial cable details.

example:

    On a NetWare 4.01 server type

    	load novserv4

    On a workstation, type

    	$(dbg) /tr=nov mynlm
