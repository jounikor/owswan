.chap Overlay manager interface
.*
For &company Debugger to be able to debug overlays, it must be able to make
requests of the overlay manager for certain operations.
The overlay manager must also be able to inform &company Debugger when a new
overlay section is loaded.
.np
When &company Debugger loads a DOS program, it looks at the initial CS:IP
value for the following structure:
.millust begin
struct ovl_header {
    unsigned_8  short_jmp_opcode;       /* == 0xeb */
    signed_8    short_jmp_displacment;
    unsigned_16 signature;              /* == 0x2112 */
    void        (far *hook)();
    unsigned_16 handler_offset;
};
.millust end
.pp
&company Debugger checks to make sure that the first instruction is a short
jump (opcode 0xeb) and that the word following that instruction contains
the value 0x2112.
If this occurs, &company Debugger assumes that it is debugging an overlaid
application.
.np
&company Debugger then fills in the
.id hook
field with the far address of a routine that is invoked with a far call
whenever a change in the overlay state occurs.
The initial CS value and the contents of the
.id handler_offset
field gives the far address of the overlay manager routine responsible for
handling debugger requests.
.*
.section The Hook Routine
.*
.np
After the routine addresses have been exchanged, &company Debugger starts
the program executing, to allow the overlay manager to initialize.
After the manager has finished its initialization, it performs a far call to
the debugger hook routine, with the return address on the stack being the
"real" starting address of the program being debugged.
All register contents (including flags) should be preserved by
the hook routine.
.np
After initialization, the debugger hook routine is invoked with a far call
every time a new overlay section is loaded into memory.
In this case the AX register contains the section number that was just loaded.
The DL register contains a zero or non-zero value if the overlay load was
caused by a call or return, respectively.
The CX:BX registers form a far pointer to the last byte of the call
instruction that caused the overlay load, in the case of a overlay load being
caused by a return instruction (DL is non-zero) the far pointer is to the last
byte of the call instruction that the return is returning from.
:NOTE. More sections than just the one identified by the section number in AX
may be loaded by the overlay manager before the hook routine is called.
The current overlay manager also loads all of the ancestors of a section (See
the WLINK documentation in the Users' Guide for a description of what an
ancestor is).
To find out what sections are really in memory the debugger should invoke
the handler routine with a GET_OVERLAY_STATE request.
.*
.section The Handler Routine
.*
.np
The handler routine is responsible for processing requests from the debugger
pertaining to overlays.
It is invoked by the debugger by performing a far call with a request number
in the AX register.
The AX register is used to return the result or return status of the request.
The CX and BX registers are used for some requests to pass a far pointer to
memory.
.np
There are two structures that the handler routines deals with.
The first is called an  overlay state.
An overlay state consists of a block of memory containing all the information
necessary for the overlay manager to restore the overlays to their current
condition at some later point in time.
The first portion of this block is a bit vector, with each bit representing
an overlay section.
If the bit is a one, then the overlay section is currently in memory.
If the bit is a zero then the overlay section is not in memory.
To convert from a section number to a bit position use the following formulas:
.millust begin
byte_offset = (section_number - 1) / 8;
bit_number  = (section_number - 1) % 8;
.millust end
.pp
Following the bit vector is information that the manager uses to restore the
overlay stack.
.np
The second structure used is an overlay address.
This consists of a far pointer followed by a 16-bit section number.
.np
The following requests are recognized by the debug handler routine.
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section GET_STATE_SIZE
.*
.millust begin
Inputs:                         Outputs:
AX = request number (0)         AX = size of overlay state
.millust end
.np
This request returns the number of bytes required for an overlay state.
.*
.section GET_OVERLAY_STATE
.*
.millust begin
Inputs:                         Outputs:
AX = request number (1)         AX = 1
CX:BX = far pointer to memory
        to store overlay state
.millust end
.np
This request copies the overlay state into the memory pointed at by
the CX:BX registers.
A one is always returned in AX.
.*
.section SET_OVERLAY_STATE
.*
.millust begin
Inputs:                         Outputs:
AX = request number (2)         AX = 1
CX:BX = far pointer to memory
        to load overlay state
.millust end
.np
This request takes a previously obtained overlay state and causes the overlay
manager to return itself to that overlay configuration.
A one is always returned in AX.
The overlay manager will not explicitly unload a section that is not in memory
according to the given overlay state, so a GET_OVERLAY_STATE request following
a SET_OVERLAY_STATE may not return the same bit vector portion.
This request may also be used by the debugger to explicitly load a section,
so the assembly code may be examined, perhaps.
To do this, zero out a block of memory the size of an overlay state, and then
turn on the appropriate section number in the bit vector, then make a
SET_OVERLAY_STATE request.
Remember that not only that section will be loaded, but all of its ancestor
sections as well.
.*
.section TRANSLATE_VECTOR_ADDR
.*
.millust begin
Inputs:                         Outputs:
AX = request number (3)         AX = 1 if addr was translated,
CX:BX = far pointer to               0 otherwise
        overlay address
.millust end
.np
This request checks to see if the far pointer portion of the overlay address
pointed at by CX:BX is actually an overlay vector.
If the address is a vector then the vector address is replaced by the true
address of the routine that the vector is for, and the section number portion
is filled in with the section number the of routine.
A one is returned in AX in this case.
If the address is not an overlay vector, then the overlay address is untouched
and an zero is returned in AX.
.*
.section TRANSLATE_RETURN_ADDR
.*
.millust begin
Inputs:                         Outputs:
AX = request number (4)         AX = 1 if addr was translated,
CX:BX = far pointer to               0 otherwise
        overlay address
.millust end
.np
In order
to handle parallel overlay calls, the overlay manager replaces the true return
address on the stack with that of some special code (the parallel return code).
It then takes the original return address and section number an places them
on the overlay stack.
When a routine returns to the overlay manager, it pops the top entry of the
overlay stack, makes sure that the original overlay section is loaded, and
returns to the original return address.
.np
This function performs much the same function as TRANSLATE_VECTOR_ADDR,
except that rather than checking for a vector address, it checks to see
if the address is that of the overlay manager parallel return code.
If it is then the section number in the overlay address is used as the number
of entries down in the overlay stack that the real return address and section
number is to be found (zero is the top entry of the overlay stack).
The true return address and section number then replaces the contents of
the overlay address and a one is returned in AX.
If the address is not the parallel return code, then the overlay address is
left untouched and a zero is returned in AX.
.*
.section GET_OVL_TBL_ADDR
.*
.millust begin
Inputs:                         Outputs:
AX = request number (5)         AX = 0
CX:BX = far pointer to variable
        of type far pointer to
        be filled in with
        overlay table address
.millust end
.np
This request fills in the far pointer pointed at by CX:BX with the address
of the overlay table so that a profiler can find out where sections are
located in the executable, or overlay files.
The sampler program, when it detects that it is sampling a overlaid
application, can perform this function and write the result into the sample
file.
Since the overlay table is always in the root, the profiler can then find
the overlay table and from that, find the other sections.
It should be noted that the format of the overlay table may change,
so this call should be avoided if at all possible.
.*
.section GET_MOVED_SECTION
.*
.millust begin
Inputs:                         Outputs:
AX = request number (6)         AX = 1 if the section exists
CX:BX = far pointer to               0 otherwise
        overlay address
.millust end
.np
With the dynamic overlay manager, sections may be loaded, or moved, to
positions other than where the linker originally placed them.
The debugger must be informed of the new positions so that it can update the
locations of its symbolic information.
The GET_MOVED_SECTION request is responsible for informing the debugger what
sections have moved and their new locations.
The debugger will call this request after the hook routine has been called,
or the debugger has invoked the SET_OVERLAY_STATE request.
The request returns the first section whose id larger than the section number
that is in the overlay address being passed in.
The overlay manager will fill in the overlay address with the section number
that has moved and its new segment address.
The offset portion of the overlay address is unused.
The request will return a one in AX.
If there are no sections numbers larger than the one being passed in that have
moved, a zero is returned.
.np
Here is some example debugger code:
.millust begin
void CheckMovedSections()
{
    overlay_address     addr;

    addr.sect_id = 0;
    while( OvlHandler( GET_MOVED_SECTION, &addr ) ) {
        HandleMovedSection( addr.sect_id, addr.segment );
    }
}
.millust end
.*
.section GET_SECTION_DATA
.*
.millust begin
Inputs:                         Outputs:
AX = request number (7)         AX = 1 if the section exists
CX:BX = far pointer to               0 otherwise
        overlay address
.millust end
.np
This request returns information on the current location of a section while
it is in memory (or where it would be if it was loaded).
The section number portion of the overlay address is filled in with the
section id that information is being requested about before the request
is made.
The overlay manager returns zero in AX if the section does not exist.
Otherwise it returns one and fills in the overlay address with the location
that the section is in memory, or where it would currently go if it was
loaded at that time.
It also fills in the section number portion of the address with the size of
the section in paragraphs.
.endlevel
.*
.section Overlay Table Structure
.*
.np
The pointer returned by the GET_OVL_TBL_ADDR request has the following format:
.millust begin
typedef struct ovl_table {
    unsigned_8      major;
    unsigned_8      minor;
    void            far *start;
    unsigned_16     delta;
    unsigned_16     ovl_size;
    ovltab_entry    entries[ 1 ];
} ovl_table;
.millust end
.np
The fields
.id major
and
.id minor
field contain version numbers for the overlay table structure.
If an upwardly compatible change in the structures is made, the minor number
will be incremented.
If a non-upwardly compatible change to the structures is made, the major
field will be incremented.
The current major version is &ovl_majver., the current minor version is
&ovl_minver..
The
.id start
field contains a 32-bit far pointer to the "actual" starting address of
the program.
The overlay manager jumps to this address after it has finished initializing
(If a debugger/sampler is present then the overlay manager calls into
the hook routine with this address on the return stack).
The
.id delta
field contains the value to be added to each of the segment relocations when
a section is loaded into memory (it contains the segment value for the first
segment in the program).
The
.id ovl_size
field contains the size of the overlay area.
This is only used in the dynamic overlay manager.
The final field,
.id entries
, is a variable sized array containing one entry for each overlay section in
the program (e.g. the tenth element in the array describes overlay section 10).
Each entry has the following form:
.millust begin
typedef struct ovltab_entry {
    unsigned_16         flags_anc;
    unsigned_16         relocs;
    unsigned_16         start_para;
    unsigned_16         code_handle;
    unsigned_16         num_paras;
    unsigned_16         fname;
    unsigned_32         disk_addr;
} ovltab_entry;
.millust end
.np
The top bit of the
.id flag_anc
field contains an indicator, while the program is running, of whether the
overlay section is in memory (value one) or must be loaded from disk
(value zero).
The next highest bit is filled in by the linker and informs the overlay
manager that the section must be loaded during the overlay manager
initialization.
The remaining bits contain the overlay number for the ancestor of this section
(zero if there is none).
The
.id relocs
field say how many segment relocation items there are for this section, while
the
.id start_para
field gives the location in memory (relative to the start of the program)
that the section should be placed when loaded.
The
.id num_paras
field contains the size of the section in paragraphs, and the
.id code_handle
field is used for various purposes inside the dynamic overlay loader.
The
.id fname
field has the offset of the address of a zero terminated string for the name
of the file containing the overlay section data and relocations (The segment
value is the same as the overlay table).
If the top bit of the offset is on, then the file is the original EXE file
rather than a separate overlay file, and the overlay manager should use the
program file name obtained from DOS (if the version is 3.0. or greater).
The
.id disk_addr
field gives the starting offset the overlay data in the overlay file.
The segment relocation items immediately follow the data.
.np
The end of the
.id entries
array is indicated when an element's
.id flags_anc
field contains the value 0xffff.
The remaining fields in that element contain garbage values.
