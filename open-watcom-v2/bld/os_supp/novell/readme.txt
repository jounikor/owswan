Due to the nature of the NetWare files needed to build a lot of the Watcom debugging tools, they are
not publically available in one SDK so any files required will be checked in to this folder and it's
children (legality depending).

The main developer kit is usually installed in %NOVELLNDK (C:\Novell\NDK\NWSDK).

The base development kits installed for this development were started with:
