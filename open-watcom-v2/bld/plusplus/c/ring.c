* Description:  Ring support.
*
****************************************************************************/

/*
    Notes:  (1) These functions are not type-safe; they act on structures
                that are assumed to contain the ring pointer in the first
                position of the structure.

            (2) A ring is located by its header pointer, which is NULL to
                when the ring is empty.  Otherwise, it points at the last
                element in the ring.  Each element points to the next
                element (the last points to the first).

            (3) The traversal routines (RingWalk...) are written so that
                the next element is located before the associated routine
                is called; this means that the routine can free the current
                element without side effects.
