Schedule: C++       92/06
========

- language supported: 3.0 without templates, error handling

- schedule:

Left to do:    compiler implementation
==========

(1) long double
    -----------
    - awaiting codegen support
    - should work with minor effort (3 line change!)

(2) linker support
    --------------
    - a - Jim Randall now working on it

(3) CodeGen Support
    ---------------
    - a - need COMDEF support for both code and data
    - b - need to adapt to 3(a) in compiler

(4) Pragma support
    --------------
    - a - need support for language linkages
    - b - make warnings levels different or as errors
    - c - extended information during compilation
    - d - need support for class generation
        - public, extern, local
        - virtual base threshhold (?)
    - e - re-implement traditional C pragma support (commented out)

(5) Message Support
    ---------------
    - need extra message information
    - need to react to pragma requesting extra information

(6) Data
    ----

(7) Expressions
    -----------
    - g - support :>

(8) Function Support
    ----------------

(9)Operational Support
    -------------------
    - a - review options and upgrade
    - b - implement profile file for options

(10)Error Handling
    --------------

(11)Templates
    ---------

(12)Asm Support
    -----------
    - Fred has it in C; we can likely get it easily

(13)Declarations
    ------------
    - templates
    - exception handling - statement parsing
    - parser ambiguity resolution

(14)OverLoading
    -----------

(15)Debugging
    ---------
    - should be just code-generation work

(16)C header Files
    --------------
    - need to be edited to add extern "C" { }


Dependencies on others
======================

- 1 - long double: code generation required
- 2 - linker support
