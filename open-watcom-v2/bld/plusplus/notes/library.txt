This is an attempt to rationalize the library names.
The idea is to make the library naming consistent with existing practice
and not too different from our current names.

Upon consultation with Brian and Jim R. the following library
naming and positioning scheme seems good:

%WATCOM%\lib286\cpplibs.lib
%WATCOM%\lib286\cpplibm.lib
%WATCOM%\lib286\cpplibl.lib
%WATCOM%\lib286\cpplibh.lib
%WATCOM%\lib286\win\cpplibs.lib		<- compiled with -zw switch
%WATCOM%\lib286\win\cpplibm.lib		<- "
%WATCOM%\lib286\win\cpplibl.lib		<- "
%WATCOM%\lib286\win\cpplibh.lib		<- "
%WATCOM%\lib386\cpplib3r.lib
%WATCOM%\lib386\cpplib3s.lib

The libraries for iostream,complex,string1,string2 can use the same scheme.

The act of making a reference copy of the library would copy the library
to plusplus\bin and to the appropriate spot in the \lang hierarchy.

There is a #pragma library ( "name" ) that can be included in the appropriate
header files to cause the object file to point at the proper libraries.
Greg will add these pragmas to the header files.
