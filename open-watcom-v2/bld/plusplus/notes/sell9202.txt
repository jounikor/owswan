WATCOM Confidential Document
============================

This document describes the WATCOM C++ product which is under development.


Mission Statement:
------------------

    - to develop the best PC-based C++ compiler for professional developers


Implementation Overview:
------------------------

    - uses same code-generation technology as WATCOM C, and so
        - will produce superior code
        - will be supported on same hardware platforms
        - is link-compatible with WATCOM C
        - the WATCOM version will be smaller and faster than our competitors

    - will support the ANSI standard for C++ including templates and
      exception handling
        - commonly known as AT&T 3.0 language standard
        - Borland is close to this
        - Microsoft is reportedly 2.1
        - Metaware will support same language as ours
        - Jenson is 2.1

    - will have superior error diagnosis (about 400 error messages now)
        - seems better than Borland now
        - Metaware also concentrating on this area

    - will require 286/386 to compile source; will produce code for all
      targets


    - initial release will not have entensive C++ libraries

    - main concentration for first release is on the compiler

Timing
------

    - Beta version in June

    - a few customers will receive earlier versions

    - general release in early fall


What we can do now: build relationships
-------------------

    - encourage vendors of C++ libraries to send us code

    - find out who wishes to participate in the Beta program

    - listen to any requirements that potential users may indicate

    - vendors of integrated environments or of CASE tools should be
      cultivated to support our compiler
