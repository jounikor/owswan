Stuff to do after ship of alpha
===============================

(1) (DONE) BaseRemove -- remove this function (same as TypedefModifierRemove)

(2) (JWW) FOLD.C -- remove CNV_FIX protection
    - protection is disabled, now, and can be removed

(3) (DONE) GUARD_IMPL -- remove #define from SRCFILE.H
                     -- re-compile all modules which reference it

(4) (DONE) set up new header for source files.

(5) (DONE) handle the (ptr. to extern "C" function conversion) to/from
    (ptr. to function)
    - allow when class value is neither returned nor passed
    - otherwise, there will a problem indirectly calling the function
    - decide whether this is an error or a level 1 warning (could be used
      for a purpose other than call, or the user code could handle the
      different calling conventions)

(6) (JWW) decide how to handle intrinsic functions (sin, cos, etc)

    use #pragma intrinsic( fun [,fun] [,fun] )

(7) (JWW) optimize away remaining copy-ctor of ctor
    - introduce opcode for ctor-call, ctor-copy
    - have optimization pass on parse tree
    - decide whether we will buffer up parse trees with CO_COMMA under
      appropriate optimization levels

(8) (DONE) CGBACK.C
    - enable reference-arguments optimizations
