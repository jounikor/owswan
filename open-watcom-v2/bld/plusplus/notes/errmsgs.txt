Error Messages Require special formatting for symbol names to become
unmunged.  To this end...

The sprintf() error message formatter has been replaced with FmtMsg().
FmtMsg() recognizes the following formatting codes:

%s - as sprintf()
%d - as sprintf()
%u - as sprintf()
%c - as sprintf()
%1 - as sprintf( "%01d" )
%2 - as sprintf( "%02d" )
%3 - as sprintf( "%03d" )
...
%9 - as sprintf( "%09d" )
%T - assumes it receives a type pointer
	the type name is formatted
%N - assumes it receives a char * pointer to a name
	that may require special formatting (i.e. $opCONV$)
%S - assumes it receives a symbol pointer
	the symbol name is formatted with type and scope resolution
	
These format codes should be used in the MESSAGES.GML file.
