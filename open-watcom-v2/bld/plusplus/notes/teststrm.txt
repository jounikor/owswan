-- UPDATES OF TEST STREAMS AND HOW TO USE THEM

-- Update to the use of teststrm:

	- there is now the option of using the DEF_CPP environment variable.
	    DEF_CPP sets the compiler to be used for the teststream.  If
	    DEF_CPP is not set, RUN386 ..\WCPPCP\WCPPCPD.EXP is used.  DEF_CPP
	    could be set to ..\BIN\WCPPCPB.EXE to test the compiler in BIN
	    
	- teststreams are still invoked by TESTSTRM.BAT [stream] from the TEST
	    directory
	    
-- New teststreams

	- EXPRES.TST:  A test of expressions including basic operators.  All
	    15 base types are tested individually.  
	  - The first file PLUSPLUS\TEST\TESTSRC\C\BADEXPR.C tests that 
	    invalid cases give errors.
	  - PLUSPLUS\TEST\TESTSRC\C\TESTEXPR.C is the source file for most
	    of the tests (all but the first).  An ouput line from TESTEXPR.C
	    has the format: [VALUE] [C++ Ref No.] [test no.].  Search for
	    [C++ Ref No.] [test no.] in TESTEXPR.C to locate the statement
	    which caused the difference.  

	- CONVERT.TST:  A test of a multitude of conversions.  
	  - PLUSPLUS\TEST\TESTSRC\C\TESTCONV.C is a generated file of 225 
	    combinations of types.  If there is a compiler error, execution
	    will produce output of the form "Test Failed: [operator] [number]"
	    Operator is +, -, *, /.  Number is the instance of the test which
	    failed.  Search for number in TESTCONV to determine which types 
	    cause the error.
