Notes on Productivity Environment
=================================

Mission:
-------

    To provide a technical environment which increases programmer 
    productivity
         
    note: "technical" means the C++ compiler and run-time environment


What we can do:
--------------
    
    * cut down time between tests (this means cutting down
      compile time)
    
    * provide run-time support for bug detection
        - zap deleted objects
        - zap lvalue passed to delete ? could affect code
    
    
Run-time Support:
----------------

    * memory tracking and related features
    
    * ctor/dtor tracker
    
    * undefined-auto initialization (to garbage)
    
    * checking parameters to run-time routines, support routines
    
    * internal integrity tests
