Notes regarding 10.0 Wish List
------------------------------

On March 10, there was a general meeting regarding plans for release 10.0.

I said that our wish list was as follows:

    (1) Optimizations
        - some code-generator independent, C++ only
        - some in conjunction with code generator

    (2) Clean up of existing source base.

    (3) Conversion to C compiler (driven by switch)
        - the current C front-end will be maintained for release 10.0

    (4) Pre-compiled headers

    (5) Some object-model work
        - Microsoft object format
        - perhaps SOM, depending upon timing of the definition

    (6) Some extensions:
        - asynchronous exceptions
        - perhaps to implement new stuff from ANSI committee

I indicated that these were only my own ideas, without input from the rest
of the C++ team.

No date has been set for release of 10.0.

Geno to circulate a complete list of goodies from the meeting.
