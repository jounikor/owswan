C++ Debugging tools
===================


(1) functions callable from wd:
    ---------------------------

    - these may be found by examining dbg.h


(2) pragmas enabling debugging information:
    --------------------------------------

    - enabled by:  #pragma on ( option ... option )

    - disabled by: #pragma off ( option ... option )

    - the following options have been defined:

        - dump_tokens:      dump tokens as they are scanned
        - dump_parse:       dump parsing information
        - dump_emit_ic:     dump intermediate code written to temp file
        - dump_exec_ic:     dump intermediate code read from temp file
        - dump_ptree:       dump parse trees
        - dump_types:       dump type information as it is built
        - dump_memory:      dump unfreed memory at end of compilation
        - dump_rank:        dump ranking information for overloads
        - dump_init:        dump data initialization steps
        - dump_cdopt:       dump cdopt caches at end of compilation
        - dump_labels:      dump front-end label processing
        - dump_mptr:        dump member pointer analysis
        - dump_mtokens:     dump macro structures
        - dump_names:       dump names table at end of compilation
        - dump_data_dtor:   dump data destruction information
        - dump_stab:        dump state tables
        - dump_blk_posn:    dump block positions
        - dump_auto_rel:    dump auto symbol relocations
        - dump_cg:          dump codegen calls
        - dump_hash:        dump hashtab statistics for scopes
        - dump_dups:        dump resolution of PT_DUPs
        - dump_using_dir:   dump 'using' directives
        - dump_member_ptr:  dump member pointer conversion analysis
        - dump_vftables:    dump vftable construction

        - auxinfo:          dump FEAuxInfo requests
