Items to be done at next global recompile:
==========================================

- compflag.h
- ic.h
    - move IC_INIT_AUTO into IC_INIT_* range
- datainit.h
    - remove auto_type field
- remove SwitchChar if we don't use it

Items we don't want to forget
=============================
- update diag0008.c once we have i64 literals (can't form type for enum diagnostic)
