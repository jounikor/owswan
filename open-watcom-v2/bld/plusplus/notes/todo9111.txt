Left to do:     rough cut at what's left 91/11
----------

(1) long double
    -----------
    - awaiting codegen support
    - should work with minor effort (3 line change!)

(2) linker support
    --------------
    - not sure state left by Jim Randall
    - what does C++ compiler need to do to get the effect?

(3) CodeGen Support
    ---------------
    - optimization of pointer deltas is not done (Brian says its coming)
    - lvalue support for assignment (John was nudged 91/10/29)
    - need to upgrade to newest code generator
        - new entry sequence

(4) Pragma support
    --------------
    - need support for language linkages
    - need support to:  - disable default generation for class, all classes
                        - enable default generation for class, all classes
                        - make warnings levels different or as errors
                        - extended information during compilation

(5) Message Support
    ---------------
    - need to track (file,line,column) in parse tree
    - need extra message information
    - need to react to pragma requesting extra information

(6) Data
    ----
    - need to do data generation

(7) Expressions
    -----------
    - work through CTOR, DTOR invocation
    - creation and destruction of temporaries
    - support for virtual classes throughout (stubbed at present)
    - operators not supported: ->*, .*, new, delete, :>, lvalue form of ?:, ::
    - lvalue assignment (awaiting codegen support)
    - additional support for ==, != (member pointers)

(8) Class support
    -------------
    - virtual classes
    - virtual functions

(9) Function Support
    ----------------
    - definition of member fns (should only require parsing support)
    - pure virtual
    - inline support required (start as out-of-line, then back off)
    - "this" pointer can be const or volatile (see pg.177 of ARM)

(10)Operational Support
    -------------------
    - review options and upgrade
    - implement profile file for options

(11)Error Handling & Templates
    --------------------------
    - need to decide if necessary
    - depends what competition implements
    - need more codegen support when we do error handling

(12)Asm Support
    -----------
    - Fred has it in C; we can likely get it easily

(13)Declarations
    ------------
    - constructor declarations      (2 days)
    - function definitions          (1 week)
    - inline function definitions   (2 days)
    - virtual functions             (???)
    - virtual bases                 (???)
    - friend declarations           (1 week)
    - abstract classes              (???)

(14)OverLoading
    -----------
    - overloading support: Greg working here
    - need to fill out the special functions in Chapter 13
    - taking address of overloaded function

(15)Debugging
    ---------
    - should be just code-generation work
