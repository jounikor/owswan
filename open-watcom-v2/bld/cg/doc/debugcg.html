<TITLE>Debugging the Watcom code generator

<BODY>
<H1>General</H1>
<P>If you want to use my <a href="vc.dbg">vc.dbg</a> command, make
sure you have a \tmp directory (see dumpio.c for details). Note: I 
usually make a s:\tmp to facilitate debugging in s:\brad :) Yeah,
it's a cheap and sleazy hack...
<P> If you need to dump something and don't know the routine to 
call, try "e/s Dump<ALT-S>" and see what pops up...

<H2>Instructions</H2>
<P> You can get a dump of instructions for current function via
<i>DumpRange</i> anytime between <i>FixEdges</i> and start of <i>GenObject</i>.
<P> You can dump an individual instruction via <i>DumpIns</i>
<P> If you need live info for a basic block, find address and call 
<i>DumpABlk( block )</i>.

<H2>Symbols</H2>
<P> If you need to see a list of symbols, use <i>DumpSymTab</i>.
<P> To look at one symbol, use <i>DumpSym</i>.

<H1>Tree Problems</H1>
<DL>
<DD> Find the line number of a piece of source near the problem.
<DD> Do a "bif { edx == LINENUMBER } <i>DBSrcCue</i>" to stop near that
<DD> Go to <i>CGDone</i> in order to see what resulting tree is (<i>DumpTree</i>)
<DD> If there is a problem with tree, but not with API calls,
do to <i>DBSrcCue</i> as above and then break on next appropriate CG API call.
</DL>

<H1>Optimization Problems (Loopopts et al)</H1>
<DL>
<DD> Find the ordinal of the problem function in the file (ie 4th function)
<DD> Do a "bcnt 4 <i>FixEdges</i>" in order to stop on 4th call (for example) to <i>FixEdges</i>
<DD> Dump instructions (using <i>DumpRange</i>) and see if problem is in trees
<DD> If not, go to <i>RegAlloc</i> and see if problem shows up yet
<DD> If so, binary search between <i>FixEdges</i> and <i>RegAlloc</i> to find optimization
at fault.
</DL>

<H1>Instruction Select Problems</H1>
<DL>
<DD> Go to <i>RegAlloc</i> for appropriate function (called once per function when not -od)
<DD> Find address of instruction which gets translated or handled improperly. (Look in 
results of <i>DumpRange</i> for this address).
<DD> Do a "bif { eax == address } <i>ExpandIns</i>" to look at what we do to this 
instruction (trace through).
</DL>

<H1>Register Allocation Problem</H1>
<DL>
<DD> Call John.
</DL>

<H1>Instruction Encoding Problem</H1>
<DL>
<DD> Go to <i>RegAlloc</i> invocation for routine in question.
<DD> Go to <i>GenObject</i> and call <i>DumpRange</i>.
<DD> Find address of instruction that gets encoded incorrectly, and do 
a "bif { eax == address } <i>GenObjCode</i>"
<DD> Trace into <i>GenObjCode</i> at appropriate time.
</DL>
