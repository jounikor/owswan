     A programming  language  serves two  related purposes: it  provides a
     vehicle  for the programmer to  specify actions to  be executed and a
     set of concepts for  the programmer to use when  thinking about  what
     can be done.  The first aspect ideally  requires  a  language that is
     `close to  the machine', so that  all important aspects of  a machine
     are handled  simply  and efficiently   in a way  that  is  reasonably
     obvious to the programmer. The C language was primarily designed with
     this in  mind. The second aspect  ideally requires a language that is
     `close  to the problem to  be   solved'  so  that the  concepts of  a
     solution  can be expressed directly   and concisely.  The  facilities
     added to C to create C++ were primarily designed with this in mind.
