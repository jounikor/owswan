* Description:  Verify that NOMINMAX works correctly with <windows.h>.
*               This is in OWSTL because, if the macros max(a,b) and
*               min(a,b) are defined by <windows.h> when it is included
*               before <algorithm> or <limits> (or <deque> or <vector>,
*               which include <limits>), then compiler errors result
*               because the macros conflict with the template functions
*               (<algorithm>) or static member functions (<limits>) with
*               the same names.
*
* Useage Notes: This file should be used to test these two files:
*                   Windefs.h in h\nt
*                   Win16.h in h\win
*               It has been tested with Windows XP and OS/2 and it works
*               with bt=nt or bt=os2 (respectively), provided the include
*               path includes exactly one of h\nt or h\win (depending on
*               which one is being tested).
*               To verify this test's functionality, simply open the
*               file(s) given above and de-activate (comment out) the
*               NOMINMAX macro test. When the macro test in the file is
*               disabled, this test will report failure; when the macro
*               test is enabled (uncommented), this test will report
*               success. Doing this one file at a time will show that
*               each test is, in fact, testing the correct file.
