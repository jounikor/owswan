Open Watcom Setup Program Reference
===================================

 NB: See also the 'Unattended Installation' wiki page at openwatcom.org.

 This document describes how to use the setup utility. It does not describe
the syntax or semantics of the setup.inf file; for that, please refer to
setupinf.txt.

 The installation is controlled by a setup script. This script is usually
called setup.inf. See below for description of how the setup script is
located.


 Setup Options
 -------------

 The installer is typically started without any arguments, allowing the
user to set installation options interactively. However, it can be run with
arguments to facilitate unattended installation. The syntax is as follows:

 setup -f=<var_file> -d<name=val) -i -s -np -ns

  The options are case insensitive. Their description follows:


 -f=<var_file>  <var_file> is an override file which contains presets
                overriding the default variable settings determined by
                the setup script. The override file can be used to change
                the initial selection for interactive installs, but typically
                it is used for unattended installation

 -d<name=val>   sets variable <name> to <val>; the set of variables which can
                be controlled by -d is different from the variables controlled
                by the -f option

 -s             skips initial dialogs but shows installation progress; if -s
                is used, the setup utility will perform an unattended install

 -i             invisible; same as -s, but additionally hides output

 -np            no GUI shell icons or shortcuts are created

 -ns            no startup files or Registry entries are modified; the user
                may need to set up environment variables manually


 In addition to the above options, the installer supports up to three
arguments. These arguments are not documented and are subject to change. They
are typically used only during development and testing and end users should
not need them. The general syntax is:

 setup [options] [<arc_name> [inf_name [src_path]]]

 where:

 <arc_name>  is the name of a ZIP archive which contains all source files.
             If not specified, this is the installer executable, that is,
             a self-extracting installer is assumed. If a self-extracting
             installer does not exist, source files are searched for directly
             on the host filesystem.

 <inf_name>  is the name of the setup script. By default, this is 'setup.inf'.
             For a self-extracting installer, this file is expected to be in
             stored in the root directory of the archive. Otherwise, it is
             assumed to be located in the same directory where the setup
             utility was started from.

 <src_path>  is the path containing source files. By default, this is the
             same location where setup.inf is found.


 Automatic Variables
 -------------------

 The override file passed to the installer via the -f option can be used to
affect the default component selection. If the -f option is not specified,
the installer makes default choices based on the host operating system and
other factors. These are so-called automatic variables. Note that if an
override file is used, any automatic variable which is not explicitly set in
the override file will be cleared (i.e., false).

 Automatic variables for the Open Watcom C/C++ product:

 ms              - small model 16-bit libraries
 mm              - medium model 16-bit libraries
 mc              - compact model 16-bit libraries
 ml              - large model 16-bit libraries
 mh              - huge model 16-bit libraries
 3r              - register calling convention 32-bit libraries
 3s              - stack calling convention 32-bit libraries
 tools16         - install 16-bit tools and libraries
 cplusplus       - install C++ components
 doshost         - DOS host tools
 winhost         - Win16 host tools
 wnthost         - Windows NT and 9x host tools
 wnt64host       - Windows 64-bit host tools
 os2host         - OS/2 host tools
 lnxhost         - Linux x86 host tools
 lnx64host       - Linux x64 host tools
 rdoshost        - RDOS host tools
 dostarg         - DOS target files
 wintarg         - Win16 target files
 wnttarg         - Win32 target files
 os2targ         - OS/2 target files
 lnxtarg         - Linux x86 target files
 nlmtarg         - Novell NLM target files
 rdostarg        - RDOS target files
 win16_helpfiles - help files in Win16 .hlp format
 win32_helpfiles - help files in Win32 .hlp format
 whelp_helpfiles - help files in whelp .ihp format
 os2_helpfiles   - help files in OS/2 .hlp/.inf format
 pdf_helpfiles   - documentation in PDF format
 whtml_helpfiles - help files in whtml .chm format
 rtsource        - run-time library startup source
 samples         - sample source code


 A sample override file follows:

---------------override.inf---------------
# Install small and large model libs
ms=true
ml=true
tools16=true
# Install only register call 32-bit libs
3r=true
# Install C++ development support
cplusplus=true
# Install only Win32 host and target
wnthost=true
wnttarg=true
# Install Win32 help files, too
win32_helpfiles=true
------------------------------------------

 Note that the choice to install a component typically depends on two or more
variables. Thus given the above override file, no 16-bit libraries will be
installed because even if the installation of small and medium model libraries
was enabled, the Windows NT target does not include any 16-bit libraries.
However, 16-bit compiler executables for the Windows NT host will be installed
because the 'tools16' variable was set.

 Running the setup with '-f=override.inf' and no other options (assuming that
override.inf is in the current directory) will allow the user to easily check
the effect of the override file by examining the default component selection
in the installer.


 Other Variables
 ---------------

 The -d option allows the user to set variables which affect fundamental
aspects of the installer operation. When using the -d option, boolean
variables (i.e. variables which may be either true or false) should be set
to 0 or 1.

 A non-exhaustive list follows:

 FullInstall    - install all source files
 DstDir         - destination directory for installation
 UnInstall      - uninstall previously installed product

 The destination directory for Open Watcom C/C++ is controlled by the WATCOM
environment variable. If the environment variable does not exist, the default
directory is 'c:\watcom'. Setting DstDir overrides the defaults.
