; This is the main executable entry point. The SVR4/i386 ABI (pages 3-31, 3-32)
; says that when the entry point runs, most registers' values are unspecified,
; except for:
;
;   EDX - Contains a function pointer to be registered with `atexit'.
;         This is how the dynamic linker arranges to have DT_FINI
;         functions called for shared libraries that have been loader
;         before this code runs.
;
;   ESP - The stack contains the arguments and environment:
