/*
 -------------------------------------------
 Tossed old algorithm and wrote new one.
 No longer based on delay loop iteration.
 No initialization delay. Works on
 multi-processing operating systems (even DOS).
 Minimum delay is 50-60 milliseconds.
 Seems to be accurate to within 10 milliseconds.
 -------------------------------------------

   The trouble with the old code is that in a multitasking OS, the
 initial calibration may be wildly inaccurate! That's why the algorithm
 was scrapped.

/*
    Under DOS, the resolution of the clock seems to be about 5/100 to
    6/100 of a second. This means that the hundredths of a second
    reported by DOS jumps by 5/100 to 6/100 whenever it ticks over.
    The old algorithm tried to determine a suitable iteration count
    that would equate to a delay of 1 millisecond. It tried to
    determine this count in 10/100 second but the resolution is 5/100
    to 6/100 so wildly varying counts would be calculated. This just
    didn't work with a clock resolution that was so poor and certainly
    doesn't work on a multi-tasking OS where other factors can slow
    down execution resulting in a poor choice for an iteration count.

    A simple case is DOS, where a program was run from floppy disk.
    The iteration count during floppy spin down was much lower than
    when the floppy had stopped spinning.

    The revised algorithm converts the time of day into a millisecond
    value and then loops while the current time of day (in
    milliseconds) is less than the initial time + the delay desired.
    It accounts for the roll-over at midnight.

    Notes:
        Some NEC PC98 models have a broken hundredth of a second
        clock. The hundredths are always reported as 0.

/*
    Claims that should be verified by Softboat
    ------------------------------------------

    On some NEC machines, DL contains the number of milliseconds with
    the oddity that it only counts from 0 to 99 and then sits on 99
    for the remaining 9/10th of a second.
