*
*  Synopsis:    p = _fjstrncpy( to, from, n );
*
*               FJSTRING        p;      return value same as distination

*               int             n;      number of letters should be copied
*
*  Description: The _fjstrncpy function copy no more than "n" characters from
*               the string pointed to by "from" into the array pointed to
*               by "to". Copying of overlapping objects is not guaranteed
*               to work properly. This function is a data independent form
*               that accept far pointer argunments. It is most useful in mix
*               memory model applications.
*
*  Returns:     The _fjstrncpy function returns the value of "to".
