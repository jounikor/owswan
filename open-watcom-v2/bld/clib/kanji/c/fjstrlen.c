*
*  Description: The _fjstrlen function compute the length of string pointed to
*               by s with in KANJI letter. This function is a data independent
*               form that accept far pointer argunments. It is most useful
*               in mix memory model applications.
*
*  Returns:     The _fjstrlen function returns the number of letters that
*               precede the terminating null character.
