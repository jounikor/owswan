 codechk tool
 ============

 The codechk tool serves one specific purpose: parse a .gml file that
contains descriptions of compiler error messages with examples, extract the
examples one by one and create source files, then run the corresponding
compiler and verify that the appropriate error/warning message was indeed
generated. There is a C++ and Java version (the latter somewhat useless).

 The C++ version is intended to be run against bld\plusplus\gml\messages.gml.
