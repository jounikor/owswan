	FHOURSTONES benchmark 

	It will be best to first create a directory (e.g., 'c4') to 
	hold all the files.


1.      UNPACKING c4.shar

	Do the following to unpack c4.shar:


	sh c4.shar


2.      CHANGING COMPILER OPTIONS

	To change compiler options edit 'Makefile'.
	
	The compiler default options are:     '-O -DUNIX -DSMALL'.
	You can change this, for example, to: '-O4 -DMOD64 -DCTimer'
	or whatever options are appropriate to your system and compiler.
	
	'-DUNIX -DSMALL' is in the 'DEFINES =' row of 'Makefile'.
	'-O'is in the 'FLAGS =' row of 'Makefile'. 
	
	Below is a summary of the various options available:

	
	(a) The SMALL option
	    Makes program use chars and shorts in moderately sized
	    arrays of small integers.  In general this option
	    produces best results, but not always ... See the 
	    README file for more information.


	(b) The MOD64 option
	    Computes the modulo hash function directly with 64-bit
	    integers.  This is only advised on machines with hardware
	    integer divide (64 / 64 --> 64 bits) and multiply
	    (64 * 64 --> 128 bits) ... See the README file for more
	    information.

	
	(c) The timer options

	The default '-DUNIX' option is one of several timer options
	avaliable.
	
	The timer option MUST be specified for the program to compile.
	
	The various timer options available are covered in 'mach.c'
	which you may need to examine to find the right match for your 
	machine. Here are the current timer choices:

	'-DAmiga'       for Amiga systems.
	'-DUNIX'        for UNIX systems (preferred)
	'-DUNIX_Old'    for UNIX systems (avoid if possible)
	'-DVMS'         for VMS systems 
	'-DBORLAND_C'   for PC's with Borland C
	'-DMSC'         for PC's with Microsoft C
	'-DMAC'         for Macintosh systems with Think C
	'-DIPSC'        for i860 IPSC systems
	'-DFORTRAN_SEC' for Cray systems (preferred)
	'-DGTODay'      for UNIX systems
	'-DCTimer'      for Cray systems (avoid if possible)
	'-DUXPM'        for Fijitsu UXP/M systems.


3.      COMPILING WITH MAKE

	Do the following to compile with make:

	make c4

	or you can try:

	make together

	Compiling with 'make together' may be the best choice, but 
	then there are always exceptions to any rule.


4.      COMPILING OTHERWISE

	Do the following to compile without 'make' if necessary:
	[using the default compiler options which you can change
	of course to suite your machine/system]

	cc -O -DUNIX -DSMALL -c c4.c
	cc -O -DUNIX -DSMALL -c trans.c
	cc -O -DUNIX -DSMALL -c best.c
	cc -O -DUNIX -DSMALL -c play.c
	cc -O -DUNIX -DSMALL -c mach.c
	cc -O -DUNIX -DSMALL -o c4 c4.o trans.o best.o play.o mach.o 
	
	This creates the executable program 'c4'.

	There is also the 'make together' way:

	cc -O -DUNIX -DSMALL -o c4 c4.c trans.c best.c play.c mach.c

	This latter method is of course more logical for global
	optimization.


5.      RUNNING THE PROGRAM

	Do the following to run the program:

	c4 < input >> c4run.doc


6.      REPORTING RESULTS

	Edit the ascii file 'c4run.doc' and please add in the 
	following:

    MACHINE/SYSTEM/MODEL: [ e.g., HP 9000/735 ]
		     CPU: [ e.g., PA-RISC 7100 ]
   CPU CLOCK SPEED (MHz): [ e.g., 99.0 MHz ]
	   OS/OS-VERSION: [ e.g., HP-UX 9.00 ]
	COMPILER/VERSION: [ e.g., gcc 1.95.02 ]
	COMPILER OPTIONS: [ e.g., -DUNIX -DSMALL -O2 -finline-functions ]
		
		COMMENTS: [ e.g., '-O12' would not compile ]    
		    
		    NAME: [ e.g., Flora Walker ]
		    DATE: [ e.g., 22 Aug 1993 ]
	   EMAIL ADDRESS: [ e.g., walker@garden.state.edu ]

	Email c4run.doc to aburto@marlin.nosc.mil and I will include
	in, and maintain, table of results. Results and other programs 
	are available via anonymous ftp to 'ftp.nosc.mil' in
	directory 'pub/aburto'. The IP address is: 128.49.192.51

	Thank you very much ...
