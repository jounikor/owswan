 * DebuggingLog is a class intended to be used only while debugging
 * an application.  It would normally be used as a static member of a
 * class, and that class would write debugging information to the log

 * timing information is available throught the use of startTiming and
 * endTiming.  call startTiming, then endTiming returns the numbers of
 * seconds since startTiming (calls are stacked)
