Draft proposal for WATCOM extension to .debug_macinfo to describe
references (expansions) of macros embedded in code.


This is currently implemented by the dwarf writing library, in DWMacUse()


MACINFO_vend_ext
	followed by line number ULEB128
	0x01	indicates references
		followed by null-terminated macro name which is used
		on this line
