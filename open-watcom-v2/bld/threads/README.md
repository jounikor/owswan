Threads
=======

This project is intended to provide standard thread libraries for Open
Watcom. It is currently being developed independently of the main Open
Watcom code base. Once it reaches a certain level of maturity and
completeness it will be merged into the normal Open Watcom build and
distributed.

There are three standard thread libraries of interest: POSIX threads, C++
2011's std::thread, and C 2011's threads.h. Ideally all three libraries
will eventually be completed for all relevant target platforms and
distributed with Open Watcom. In reality, due to limited developer
resources it is likely only a (small?) subset of these libraries will be in
a reasonable state at any given time.
