* Description:  Cover routines to access the trmem memory tracker for
*               programs that have no special needs.
*
****************************************************************************/


/*

The assumptions that these routines make are:
    - memory alloction is done through malloc, free, realloc
    - error messages are printed to stderr using write
    - all trmem checks are performed (all flags are set on)
    - all memory allocation throughout these routines uses the same memory
            tracker (i.e. same memory handle)

To use these routines compile trmemcvr.c into your program with the following
compile options:  -DTRMEM -of+

If you leave off these options, trmemcvr will use malloc, free, realloc
and strdup directly.

No special options are required for routines that call the routine in trmemcvr.
