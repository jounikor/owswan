Here are some things that were not completed:

- the library doesn't check if it is being asked to generate info for the
	browser or debugger.  Basically the only thing that this should be
	checked for is the .debug_aranges and .debug_pubnames sections.

- Anthony's example:
		struct B {
		    int x, y;
		}
		struct D : private B {
		    B::y;
		}
    still has no mapping... this depends on how the DWARF guys decide
    we should map it.

- I didn't test labels in location expressions.

- dwcnf.h has some pretty arbitrary types in it;  I think that it will
	need to be changed depending on how Brian decides to store
	addresses in the files.  In particular, dw_targ_addr should
	probably just be an uint_32.  The current dwcnf.h is basically
	for testing purposes only.

- The examples in the docs are just plain wrong... the only real examples
	available are those in testtest.c.
