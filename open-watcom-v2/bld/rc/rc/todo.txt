 Here's what is missing in wrc but doesn't appear to be essential:
 
- Currently wrc stuffs all resources into a single resource object. IBM's RC 
 puts PRELOAD and LOADONCALL resources into different objects. We also ignore
 the SEGALIGN attribute, while IBM's RC creates a new object for each
 SEGALIGNed resource.
 
- Page compression. IBM's RC supports two types of compression: Iterated
 pages and a proprietary LZSS-ish algorithm. The former algorithm is supported
 on OS/2 2.0 and later, the latter requires OS/2 Warp. Iterated pages use
 trivial RLE compression, but the newer compression algorithm is completely
 undocumented. However, lxLite source code ought to provide the necessary
 information to anyone who can read Pascal and x86 assembly.

  If compression were added to wrc, it would probably make good sense to
 also add it to wlink, or perhaps give wrc the ability to compress
 non-resource pages.
