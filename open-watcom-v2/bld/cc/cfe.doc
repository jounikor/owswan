        C Front End Notes
        -----------------

1. Major header files
   The major header files are cvars.h, ctypes.h and cops.h. Most source
   files need only include cvars.h.
   cvars.h      - primary include file. The file includes most of the
                  other header files. Most global data variables are
                  declared here using the GLOBAL macro. All function
                  prototypes are also in this file.
   ctypes.h     - defines common data structures, enum constants
   cops.h       - defines parse tree operators and parse tree data structures
   cerrs.h      - error messages

2. Adding a new keyword:
   - the cc/h directory contains 4 files containing list of keywords
   c.key     - normal standard C keywords
   seh.key   - keywords for structured exception handling
   pc.key    - keywords generally associated with PC implementations

   e.g. to add __int64 as a keyword
   - add entry to pc.key
     The second column indicates what token class this new token
     belongs to. Token classes start with TC_ and can be found in
     ctokens.h. Since 'int' and 'long' are listed as TC_KEYWORD,
     we should make '__int64' a TC_KEYWORD.
   - wmake will run findhash which tries to find a perfect hash for
     the list of keywords it is given. If it is successful, it will
     create 2 files: weights.gh and keywords.gh

3. Adding a new error message:
   All error messages are added to cerrs.gml in the cc/gml directory. The
   GML file is included into the C compiler error message reference book;
   this is an excellent mechanism to ensure that the documentation matches
   reality. Messages come in several groups:

   - warning level 1
   - warning level 2
   - warning level 3
   - errors
   - notes

   The warning levels are defined using the warn() macro in cwngs.h. Note
   that a warn() macro is only needed for warnings and not error or note
   messages.
