.chap *refid='ipferr' Error Messages
.*
.np
The &ipfname generates four kinds of diagnostic messages: Errors and three levels of warnings. Despite
their name, warnings are really errors and indicate that &ipfcmd has produced a file that is probably
not exactly the way you wanted.
.*
.section Errors
.*
.np
Errors are always fatal and cause &ipfname to stop immediately.
.begnote $break
.note "The length of the file path is too long"
The maximum length of the file path depends on the operating system. You may need to re-arrange the
project's layout on disk.
.note "Cannot open file"
A source file cannot be opened, usually because it doesn't exist. Check the spelling of the file name.
.note "Cannot open image file"
A image file cannot be opened, usually because it doesn't exist. Check the spelling of the file name.
.note "Cannot read from file"
For some reason, reading the file has failed.
.note "Cannot write to file"
For some reason, writing to the file has failed. The disk might be full.
.note "Unexpected end of file"
The source file has unexpectedly ended. This can occur if you have forgotten the euserdoc tag.
.note "Text conversion error"
&ipfcmd uses wide characters internally. All text is converted from multi-byte characters to wide
characters when read, and back to multi-byte characters when written. If a character cannot be converted
successfully, this error is generated.
.note "Syntax error"
A syntax error has occurred. Usually, this is because an end-of-tag delimiter is missing.
.note "Invalid country code or codepage"
The appropriate file of entity references cannot be found or cannot be read. Usually, this is because the
WIPFC environment variable is not setup or is pointing to the wrong place.
.note "Invalid language code"
The appropriate nls file cannot be found or cannot be read. Usually, this is because the WIPFC environment
variable is not setup or is pointing to the wrong place.
.note "Missing :userdoc or :euserdoc"

At least one of the pages must be visible. Don't hide them all.
.note "Cannot open nls configuration file"
A NLS configuration file cannot be opened. Usually, this is because the WIPFC environment variable is not
setup or is pointing to the wrong place.
