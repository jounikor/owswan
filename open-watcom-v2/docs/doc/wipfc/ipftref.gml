.np
This section acts as a reference, describing how &ipfcmd implements each tag.

.section Overview
.*
.np
Tags are the heart of IPF markup and come in four flavors:
.autopoint
.point
Tags that appear in the document header. These tags control how the document behaves.
.point
Tags that establish blocks. These tags can contain other tags as well as text. List-blocks and tables are
special cases in that they can only contain other tags and cannot directly contain text.
.point
Tags that are in-line. These tags can contain text or other in-line tags.
.point
Formatting tags that can appear anywhere, but are usually in-line.
.endpoint
.np
This diagram classifies each tag and shows which tags can contain which other tags. Tags that are marked as
containing 'in-line' can also contain formatting and text.

.section Reference

.np
The &ipfname follows the behavior of the IBM OS/2 Help Compiler as documented in the "ipfref.inf"
help file. This means that the behavior of the two compilers is very similar but not identical, since the
IBM compiler allows certain things that the documentation says it should not. The entry for each tag that
follows describes how the &ipfname treats each tag.
