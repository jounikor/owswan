The following header files are supplied with the Open Watcom C++
library. When a class or function from the library is used in a source
file the related header file should be included in that source file. The
header files can be included multiple times and in any order with no ill
effect.
:P.
The facilities of the C standard library can be used in C++ programs by
including the appropriate "cname" header. In that case all of the C
standard library functions are in namespace
:MONO.std
:PERIOD.
For example, to use function
:MONO.std::~printf
one should include the header cstdio. Note that the cname headers
declare in the global namespace any non-standard names they contain as
extensions. It is also possible to include in a C++ program the same
headers used by C programs. In that case, the standard functions are in
both the global namespace as well as in namespace
:MONO.std
:PERIOD.
:P.
Some of C++ standard library headers described below come in a form with
a .h extension and in a form without an extension. The extensionless
headers declare their library classes and functions in namespace
:MONO.std
:PERIOD.
The headers with a .h extension declare their library classes and
functions in both the global namespace and in namespace
:MONO.std
:PERIOD.
Such headers are provided as a convenience and for compatibility with
legacy code. Programs that intend to conform to Standard C++ should use
the extensionless headers to access the facilities of the C++ standard
library.
:P.
Certain headers defined by Standard C++ have names that are
longer than the 8.3 limit imposed by the FAT16 filesystem. Such headers
are provided with names that are truncated to eight characters so they
can be used with the DOS host. However, one can still refer to them in
#include directives using their full names as defined by the standard.
If the Open Watcom C++ compiler is unable to open a header with the long
name, it will truncate the name and try again.
:P.
The Open Watcom C++ library contains some components that were developed
before C++ was standardized. These legacy components continue to be
supported and are described in this documentation.
:P.
The header files are all located in the
:MONO.\WATCOM\H
directory.

:DD.
.ix 'header files' 'complex'
This header file defines the
:MONO.std::~complex
class template and related function templates. This template can be
instantiated for the three different floating point types. It can be
used to represent complex numbers and to perform complex arithmetic.
:DT.complex.h
:DD.
.ix 'header files' 'complex'
This header file defines the legacy
:MONO.Complex
class. This class is used to represent complex numbers and to perform
complex arithmetic. The class defined in this header is not the Standard
C++
:MONO.std::~complex
class template.
:DT.exception/exception.h (exceptio/exceptio.h)
:DD.
.ix 'header files' 'exception'

the exception handling mechanism. It defines the base class of the
standard exception hierarchy.
:DT.functional (function)

includes the functors and binders described by Standard C++.

the classes are defined.
:DT.generic.h
:DD.
.ix 'header files' 'generic'

generic containers prior to the introduction of templates in the C++
language. It is retained for backwards compatibility.

:DD.
.ix 'header files' 'iomanip'
This header file defines the parameterized manipulators.
:DT.ios/ios.h
:DD.
.ix 'header files' 'ios'
This header file defines the class
:MONO.ios
that is used as a base of the other iostream classes.
:DT.iosfwd/iosfwd.h
:DD.
.ix 'header files' 'iosfwd'
This header file provides forward declarations of the iostream classes.
It should be used in cases where the full class definitions are not
needed but where one still wants to declare pointers or references to
iostream related objects. Typically this occurs in a header for another
class that wants to provide overloaded inserter or extractor operators.
By including
:MONO.iosfwd
instead of
:MONO.iostream
(for example), compilation speed can be improved because less material
must be processed by the compiler.
:P.
Note that including
:MONO.iosfwd
is the only appropriate way to forward declare the iostream classes.
Manually writing forward declarations is not recommended.
:DT.iostream/iostream.h
:DD.
.ix 'header files' 'iostream'
This header file (indirectly) defines the
:MONO.ios
:CONT.,
:MONO.istream
:CONT.,

The various class members are declared and
inline member functions for the classes are defined.
The &cin., &cout., &cerr., and &clog. predefined objects are declared
along with the non-parameterized manipulators.
:DT.istream/istream.h
:DD.

This header file defines the
:MONO.std::~numeric_limits
template and provides specializations of that template for each of the
built-in types.
:P.
Note that this header is not directly related to the header limits.h
from the C standard library (or to the C++ form of that header,
climits).
:DT.list
