:P.
Container classes define common methods to store information.
Any non-trivial program will have some type of data structure
to maintain information needed by various program components.
These data structures range from the simplicity of a vector to the
complexity of a relational database.
This library supplies some of the more common data structures used
by software developers.
:P.
The purpose of a container class is to 'contain' user data.
The class definition must take care of the implementation details.
It also provides an interface for manipulating and accessing the information.
:P.
The WATCOM container classes are all
:MONO.template
classes.
Each class will take as a minimal template parameter a
:MONO.type
value.
The following definition
.exam begin
WCValSList<int>     list_one;
.exam end
uses a templated class definition to create a list object.
The object
:MONO.list_one
is a value based single linked list of integers.
The
:MONO.type
value is integer.
This list stores copies of integers in each list item.
The implementation detail of this list is that it is a single linked list.
:P.
The container you chose can affect what operations are available to you.
For example, an iterator defined for a single linked list can only move
forward through the list.
If you want to be able to move the iterator in both directions, you should
use a double linked list.
:P.
The following definition
.exam begin
WCValDList<String>  list_two;
.exam end
illustrates that the type of the data in the list does not need to be
a scalar value such as integer or character.
The
:MONO.String
class is a product (or user) defined class for operating on character strings.
:P.
Some of the container classes have template parameters in addition to
the contained type.
The stack class has two parameters, and can be instantiated as in the
following:
.exam begin
WCStack<int,WCValSList<int> >  int_stack;
.exam end
The class
:MONO.int_stack
is a stack of integers, with the implementation of the stack supplied
by the single linked list value class.
Note that there is a space between the two '>' characters.
If you do not leave a space, the character sequence '>>' is interpreted
as the right shift operator.
:SECTION.Intrusive Classes
:P.
Some classes use the
:MONO.intrusive
.ix 'intrusive classes'
method of storing data.
These classes require the data being stored in the container to be
defined in terms of a common base class.
With this common base class, the intrusive container class can
operate on the data elements with no information about the data
stored in the element.
This requires a class definition for each data type you may wish to
store in the container.
The following definition
.exam begin
class str_sdata : public WCSLink {
    String information;
}
.exam end
will create a new class
:MONO.str_sdata
which can be used in single link intrusive list classes.
The information contained in
:MONO.str_sdata
is a
:MONO.String
value stored in the member data
:MONO.information
:PERIOD
:SECTION.Value Classes
:P.
Some classes use the
:MONO.value
.ix 'value classes'
method of storing data.
These classes make a copy of the data when creating a new element.
A new storage class definition is not required
when defining a value class.
Since the data is copied, this method may be very expensive
when the data is a complex definition or contains large elements.
:SECTION.Pointer Classes
:P.
Some classes use the
:MONO.pointer
method of storing data.
These classes store a pointer to the data when creating a new element.
A new storage class definition is not required
when defining a pointer class.
Although the
:MONO.pointer
.ix 'pointer classes'
container class is really a specialization of the
:MONO.value
class,
The storage of pointers to a particular data type
is a common use of container classes.
Providing the class definition is a convenience when specifying the
container objects.
