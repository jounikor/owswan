The &cls. is derived from the
:MONO.streambuf
class and provides additional functionality required to write characters to
and read characters from a string buffer. Read and write operations can occur
at different positions in the string buffer, since the &getptr. and &putptr.
are not necessarily connected. Seek operations are also supported.
:P.
The &resvarea. used by the &obj. may be either fixed in size or dynamic.
Generally, input strings are of a fixed size, while output streams are
dynamic, since the final size may not be predictable. For dynamic buffers,
the &obj. automatically grows the buffer when necessary.
:INCLUDE file='ssb_desc'.
:P.
C++ programmers who wish to use string streams without deriving new
objects will probably never explicitly create or use a &obj.
