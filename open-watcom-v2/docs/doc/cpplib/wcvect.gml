The &cls. is a templated class used to store objects in a vector.
Vectors are similar to arrays, but vectors perform bounds checking
and can be resized.
Elements are inserted into the vector by assigning to a vector index.
:P.
The
:MONO.WC&lpref.OrderedVector
and
:MONO.WC&lpref.SortedVector
classes are also available.  They provide a more abstract view of the vector
and additional functionality, including finding and removing elements.

.if &lpref. eq Val .do begin
:P.
Values are copied into the vector, which could be undesirable
if the stored objects are complicated and copying is expensive.
Value vectors should not be used to store objects of a base class if any
derived types of different sizes would be stored in the vector, or if the
destructor for a derived class must be called.
.do end

:P.
In the description of each member function, the text
:MONO.Type
is used to indicate the template parameter defining

.if &lpref. eq Val .do begin
the type of the elements stored in the vector.
.do end
.el .do begin
the type pointed to by the pointers stored in the vector.

:MONO.operator []
is the vector index operator.  A reference to the object stored
in the vector at the given index is returned.  If a constant vector is
indexed, a reference to a constant element is returned.
The index operator of a non-constant vector is the only way to insert
an element into the vector.
:P.
If an attempt to access an element with index greater than or equal to the
length of a non-constant vector is made and the
:MONO.resize_required
.ix 'resize_required' 'exception'
exception is enabled, the exception is thrown.  If the exception is not
enabled, the vector is automatically resized using the
:MONO.resize
member function to have length the index
value plus one.

.if &lpref. eq Val .do begin
New vector elements are initialized using
:MONO.Type's

If the resize failed, and the
:MONO.out_of_memory
.ix 'out_of_memory' 'exception'
exception is enabled, the exception is thrown.  If the exception is not
enabled and the resize failed, the last element is indexed (a new
element if the vector was zero length).
If a negative value is used to index the non-constant vector and the
:MONO.index_range
.ix 'index_range' 'exception'
exception is enabled, the exception is thrown.  If the exception is not
enabled and the vector is empty, the
:MONO.resize_required
exception may be thrown.
:P.
An attempt to index an empty constant vector may cause one of two
exceptions to be thrown.  If the
:MONO.empty_container
.ix 'empty_container' 'exception'
exception is enabled, it is thrown.  Otherwise, the
:MONO.index_range
.ix 'index_range' 'exception'
exception is thrown, if enabled.
If neither exception is enabled, a first vector element is added and
indexed (so that a reference to a valid element can be returned).
:P.
Indexing with a negative value or a value greater than or equal to the
length of a constant vector causes the
:MONO.index_range
.ix 'index_range' 'exception'
exception to be thrown, if enabled.

The &fn. returns a reference to the element at the given index.
If the index is invalid, a reference to the closest valid element is returned.
