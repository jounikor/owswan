The &cls. is a base class that provides common
functionality for the three string stream-based classes,
:MONO.istrstream
:CONT.,
:MONO.ostrstream
and
:MONO.strstream
:PERIOD.
The &cls. is derived from the
:MONO.ios
class which provides the stream state information.
The &cls. provides constructors for string stream objects and one member
function.
:HDG.Protected Member Functions
The following member functions are declared in the protected interface:
:MFNL.
:MFCD cd_idx='c'.strstreambase();
:MFCD cd_idx='c'.strstreambase( char *, int, char * = 0 );
:MFCD cd_idx='d'.~~strstreambase();
:eMFNL.
:HDG.Public Member Functions
The following member function is declared in the public interface:
:MFNL.

The &fn. creates a pointer to the
:MONO.strstreambuf
associated with the &obj.
:PERIOD.
Since the
:MONO.strstreambuf
object is embedded within the &obj.,
this function never returns &null.

The &fn. returns a pointer to the

associated with the &obj.

This form of the &fn. creates a &obj. that is initialized, but empty. Dynamic
allocation is used to store characters. No buffer is allocated. A buffer is
be allocated when data is first written to the &obj.
:PERIOD.

This form of the &fn. is only used implicitly by the compiler
when it generates a constructor for a derived class.

The &fn. creates an initialized &obj.

This form of the &fn. creates a &obj. that is initialized and uses the
buffer specified by the
:ARG.str
and
:ARG.len
parameters as its &resvarea. within the associated
:MONO.strstreambuf
object. Dynamic allocation is not used.
:P.
This form of the &fn. is unlikely to be explicitly used, except in the
member initializer list for the constructor of a derived class.
