The &cls. supports reading and writing of characters from and to the standard
input/output devices, usually the keyboard and screen.
The &cls. provides formatted conversion of characters to and from other types
(e.g. integers and floating-point numbers). The associated
:MONO.streambuf
class provides the methods for communicating with the actual device, while
the &cls. provides the interpretation of the characters.
:P.
Generally, an &obj. won't be created by a program, since there is no mechanism
at this level to "open" a device.
No instance of an &obj. is created by default, since it is usually not
possible to perform both input and output on the standard input/output
devices. The &cls. is provided as a base class for other derived
classes that can provide both input and output capabilities through the
same object. The
:MONO.fstream
and
:MONO.strstream
classes are examples of classes derived from the &cls.

This form of the &fn. creates an &obj. with an attached

Since a user program usually will not create an &obj., this form of the
&fn. is unlikely to be explicitly used, except in the member initializer
list for the constructor of a derived class. The
:ARG.sb
parameter is a pointer to a
:MONO.streambuf
object, which should be connected to the source and sink of characters for
the stream.
