This chapter describes exception handling for the container classes.

The &cls. provides the exception handling for the container classes.
If you have compiled your code with exception handling enabled,
the C++ exception processing can be used to catch errors.
Your source file must be compiled with the exception handling
compile switch for C++ exception processing to occur.
The container classes will attempt to set the container object into a reasonable
state if there is an error and exception handling is not enabled, or
if the trap for the specific error has not been enabled by your program.
:P.
By default, no exception traps are enabled and no exceptions will be thrown.
Exception traps are enabled by setting the exception state with the
:MONO.exceptions
member function.
:P.
The
:MONO.wcexcept.h
header file is included by the header files for each of the container classes.
There is normally no need to explicitly include the
:MONO.wcexcept.h
header file, but no errors will result if it is included.
This class is inherited as a base class for each
of the containers.
You do not need to derive from it directly.
:P.
The
:MONO.WCListExcept
.ix 'WCListExcept' 'class'
class (formally used by the list container classes) has been replaced by
the
:MONO.WCExcept
class.
A typedef of the
:MONO.WCListExcept
class to the
:MONO.WCExcept
class and the
:MONO.wclist_state
type to the
:MONO.wc_state
type provide backward compatability with previous
versions of the list containers.

The &fn. is used implicitly by the compiler

It is automatically used by the list container classes,

The &fn. queries and/or sets the bits that control which exceptions
are enabled for the list class.
Each bit corresponds to an exception, and is set if the exception is enabled.
The first form of the &fn. returns the current settings of the
exception bits.
The second form of the function sets the exception bits to those
specified by :HP1.set_flags:eHP1.
:PERIOD.
:RSLTS.
The current exception bits are returned.
If a new set of bits are being set, the returned value is the old
set of exception bits.

The type
:MONO.WCExcept::wcstate
is a set of bits representing the current state of the container object.
The &fn. represents the same set of bits, but uses an
:MONO.int
to represent the values, thereby avoiding problems made possible by the
compiler's ability to use smaller types for enumerations.
All uses of these bits should use the &fn.
:PERIOD.
:P.
The bit values defined by the &fn. can be read and set by the
:MONO.exceptions
.ix 'exceptions'
member function,
which is also used to control exception handling.
:P.
The
:MONO.WCExcept::not_empty
.ix 'not_empty' 'exception'
bit setting traps the destruction of a container when the container
has at one or more entries.
If this error is not trapped, memory may not be properly released back to the
system.
:P.
The
:MONO.WCExcept::index_range
.ix 'index_range' 'exception'
state setting traps an attempt to access a container item by an index value
that is either not positive or is larger than the index of the last
item in the container.
:P.
The
:MONO.WCExcept::empty_container
.ix 'empty_container' 'exception'
bit setting traps an attempt to perform and invalid operation on a
container with no entries.
:P.
The
:MONO.WCExcept::out_of_memory
.ix 'out_of_memory' 'exception'
bit setting traps any container class allocation failures.
If this exception is not enabled, the operation in which the allocation
failed will return a FALSE (zero) value.  Container class copy constructors
and assignment operators can also throw this exception, and if not enabled
incomplete copies may result.
:P.
The
:MONO.WCExcept::resize_required
.ix 'resize_required' 'exception'
bit setting traps any vector operations which cannot be performed unless the
vector is resized to a larger size.  If this exception is not enabled, the
vector class will attempt an appropriate resize when necessary for
an operation.
:P.
The
:MONO.WCExcept::not_unique
.ix 'not_unique' 'exception'
bit setting traps an attempt to add a duplicate value to a set container, or
a duplicate key to a dictionary container.  The duplicate value is not
added to the container object regardless of the exception trap state.
:P.
The
:MONO.WCExcept::zero_buckets
.ix 'zero_buckets' 'exception'
bit setting traps an attempt to resize of hash container to have zero buckets.
No resize is performed whether or not the exception is enabled.
