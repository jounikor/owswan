The &cls. is the building block for all of the double linked list classes.
It is implemented in terms of the
:MONO.WCSLink
base class.
Since no user data is stored directly with it,
the &cls. should only be used as a base class to derive a user defined class.
:P.
When creating a double linked intrusive list, the &cls. is used to derive the
user defined class that holds the data to be inserted into the list.
:P.
The
:MONO.wclcom.h
header file is included by the
:MONO.wclist.h
header file.
There is no need to explicitly include the
:MONO.wclcom.h
header file unless the
:MONO.wclist.h
header file is not included.
No errors will result if it is included.
:P.
Note that the destructor is non-virtual so that list elements are of minimum
size.
Objects created as a class derived from the &cls., but destroyed while
typed as a &obj. will not invoke the destructor of the derived class.
:CMT.The
:CMT.:MONO.WCIsvDList
:CMT.and
:CMT.:MONO.WCValDList
:CMT.are examples of classes derived from the &cls.
