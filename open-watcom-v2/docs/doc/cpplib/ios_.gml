The &cls. is used to group together common functionality needed for
other derived stream classes. It is not intended that objects of type
:MONO.ios
be created.
:P.
This class maintains state information about the stream. (the
:MONO.ios
name can be thought of as a short-form for I/O State).
Error flags, formatting flags, and values and the connection to the
buffers used for the input and output are all maintained by the &cls.
:PERIOD.
No information about the buffer itself is stored in an &obj., merely the
pointer to the buffer information.

The type
:MONO.ios::fmt_flags
is a set of bits representing methods of formatting objects written to
the stream and interpreting objects read from the stream.  The &fn.
represents the same set of bits, but uses a
:MONO.long
to represent the values, thereby avoiding problems made possible by the
compiler's ability to use smaller types for enumerations.  All uses of
these bits should use the &fn.
:PERIOD.
:P.
The bit values defined by the &fn. are set and read by the member functions
:MONO.setf
:CONT.,
:MONO.unsetf
and
:MONO.flags
:CONT., as well as the
manipulators
:MONO.setiosflags
and
:MONO.resetiosflags
:PERIOD.
:P.
Because one field is used to store all of these bits, there are three special
values used to mask various groups of bits. These values are named
:MONO.ios::basefield
:CONT.,
:MONO.ios::adjustfield
and
:MONO.ios::floatfield
:CONT.,
and are discussed with the bits that they are used to mask.
:P.
:MONO.ios::skipws
controls whether or not whitespace
characters are automatically skipped when using an
:MONO.operator~b>>
extractor.
If
:MONO.ios::skipws
is on, any use of the
:MONO.operator~b>>
extractor skips whitespace characters
before inputting the next item. Otherwise, skipping of whitespace characters
must be handled by the program.
:P.
:MONO.ios::left
:CONT.,
:MONO.ios::right
and
:MONO.ios::internal
control the alignment of items written using an
:MONO.operator~b<<
inserter.
These bits are usually used in conjunction with the &fmtwidth. and &fillchar.
:PERIOD.
:P.
:MONO.ios::adjustfield
can be used to mask the alignment bits returned by the
:MONO.setf
:CONT.,
:MONO.unsetf
and
:MONO.flags
member functions, and for setting new values to ensure that no other bits
are accidentally affected.
:P.
When the item to be written is smaller than the &fmtwidth. specified,
&fillchar.s are written to occupy the additional space. If
:MONO.ios::left
is in effect, the item is written in the left portion of the available
space, and &fillchar.s are written in the right portion. If
:MONO.ios::right
is in effect, the item is written in the right portion of the available
space, and &fillchar.s are written in the left portion. If
:MONO.ios::internal
is in effect, any sign character or base indicator is written in the
left portion, the digits are written in the right portion, and
&fillchar.s are written in between.
:P.
If no alignment is specified,
:MONO.ios::right
is assumed.
:P.
If the item to be written is as big as or bigger than the &fmtwidth. specified,
no &fillchar.s are written and the alignment is ignored.
:P.
:MONO.ios::dec
:CONT.,
:MONO.ios::oct
and
:MONO.ios::hex
control the base used to format integers being written to the stream, and
also control the interpretation of integers being read from the stream.
:P.
:MONO.ios::basefield
can be used to mask the base bits returned by the member functions
:MONO.setf
:CONT.,
:MONO.unsetf
and
:MONO.flags
:CONT., and for setting new values to ensure that no other bits are
accidentally affected.
:P.
When an integer is being read from the stream, these bits control the base
used for the interpretation of the digits. If none of these bits is set,
a number that starts with
:MONO.0x
or
:MONO.0X
is interpreted as hexadecimal (digits
:MONO.0123456789
:CONT., plus the letters
:MONO.abcdef
or
:MONO.ABCDEF
:CONT.), a number that starts with
:MONO.0
(zero) is interpreted as octal (digits
:MONO.01234567
:CONT.), otherwise the number is interpreted as decimal (digits
:MONO.0123456789
:CONT.).
If one of the bits is set, then the prefix is not necessary and the number
is interpreted according to the bit.
:P.
When any one of the integer types is being written to the stream, it can be
written in decimal, octal or hexadecimal. If none of these bits is set,
:MONO.ios::dec
is assumed.
:P.
If
:MONO.ios::dec
is set (or assumed), the integer is written in decimal (digits
:MONO.0123456789
:CONT.). No prefix is included.
:P.
If
:MONO.ios::oct
is set, the integer is written in octal (digits
:MONO.01234567
:CONT.). No sign character is written, as the number is treated as an
unsigned quantity upon conversion to octal.
:P.
If
:MONO.ios::hex
is set, the integer is written in hexadecimal (digits
:MONO.0123456789
:CONT., plus the letters
:MONO.abcdef
or
:MONO.ABCDEF
:CONT., depending on the setting of
:MONO.ios::uppercase
:CONT.).
No sign character is written, as the number is treated as an unsigned
quantity upon conversion to hexadecimal.
:P.
:MONO.ios::showbase
controls whether or not integers written to the stream in octal or
hexadecimal form have a prefix that indicates the base of the number.
If the bit is set, decimal numbers are written without a prefix,
octal numbers are written with the prefix
:MONO.0
(zero) and hexadecimal numbers are written with the prefix
:MONO.0x
or
:MONO.0X
depending on the setting of
:MONO.ios::uppercase
:PERIOD.
If the
:MONO.ios::showbase
is not set, no prefixes are written.
:P.
:MONO.ios::showpoint
is used to control whether or not the decimal point and trailing zeroes are
trimmed when floating-point numbers are written to the stream. If the bit is
set, no trimming is done, causing the number to appear with the
specified &fmtprec.
:PERIOD.
If the bit is not set, any trailing zeroes after
the decimal point are trimmed, and if not followed by any digits, the
decimal point is removed as well.
:P.
:MONO.ios::uppercase
is used to force to upper-case all letters used in formatting numbers,
including the letter-digits
:MONO.abcdef
:CONT.,
the
:MONO.x
hexadecimal prefix, and the
:MONO.e
used for the exponents in floating-point numbers.
:P.
:MONO.ios::showpos
controls whether or not a
:MONO.+
is added to the front of positive integers being written to the stream. If
the bit is set, the number is positive and the number is being written in
decimal, a
:MONO.+
is written before the first digit.
:P.
:MONO.ios::scientific
and
:MONO.ios::fixed
controls the form used for writing floating-point numbers to the stream.
Floating-point numbers can be written in scientific notation (also
called exponential notation) or in fixed-point notation.
:P.
:MONO.ios::floatfield
can be used to mask the floating-format bits returned by the member functions
:MONO.setf
:CONT.,
:MONO.unsetf
and
:MONO.flags
:CONT.,
and for setting new values to ensure that no other bits are accidentally
affected.
:P.
If
:MONO.ios::scientific
is set, the floating-point number is written with a leading
:MONO.-
sign (for negative numbers), a digit, a decimal point, more digits, an
:MONO.e
(or
:MONO.E
if
:MONO.ios::uppercase
is set), a
:MONO.+
or
:MONO.-
sign, and two or three digits representing the exponent. The digit
before the decimal is not zero unless the number is zero. The total number of
digits before and after the decimal is equal to the specified &fmtprec.
:PERIOD.
If
:MONO.ios::showpoint
is not set, trimming of the decimal and digits following the decimal
may occur.
:P.
If
:MONO.ios::fixed
is set, the floating-point number is written with a
:MONO.-
sign (for negative numbers), at least one digit, the decimal point,
and as many digits following the decimal as specified by the &fmtprec.
:PERIOD.
If
:MONO.ios::showpoint
is not set, trimming of the decimal and digits following the decimal
may occur.
:P.
If neither
:MONO.ios::scientific
nor
:MONO.ios::fixed
is specified, the floating-point number is formatted using scientific
notation provided one or both of the following conditions are met:
:UL.
:LI.the exponent is less than -4, or,
:LI.the exponent is greater than the &fmtprec.
:PERIOD.
:eUL.
:P.
Otherwise, fixed-point notation is used.
:P.
:MONO.ios::unitbuf
controls whether or not the stream is flushed after each item is written.
If the bit is set, every item that is written to the stream is followed
by a flush operation, which ensures that the I/O stream buffer associated
with the stream is kept empty, immediately transferring the data to its final
destination.
:P.
:MONO.ios::stdio
controls whether or not the stream is synchronized after each item is written.
If the bit is set, every item that is written to the stream causes the
stream to be synchronized, which means any input or output buffers are
flushed so that an I/O operation performed using C (not C++) I/O behaves in
an understandable way. If the output buffer was not flushed, writing
using C++ and then C I/O functions could cause the output from the C
functions to appear before the output from the C++ functions, since the
characters might be sitting in the C++ output buffer. Similarly, after the C
output operations are done, a call should be made to the C library
:MONO.fflush
function on the appropriate stream before resuming C++ output operations.

The second form of the &fn. is used to set the &fmtwidth. to
:ARG.wid
for the next item to be formatted.
:P.
After an item has been formatted, the &fmtwidth. is reset to zero.
Therefore, any non-zero &fmtwidth. must be set before each item that is
to be formatted.
