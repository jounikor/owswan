The &cls. is derived from the

to communicate with external files.
Seek operations are supported when the underlying file supports seeking.
Both input and output operations may be performed using a &obj.,
again when the underlying file supports read/write access.

&obj.s are buffered by default, so the &resvarea. is allocated automatically
unless one is specified when the &obj. is created.

There is only one current position in a &obj.
