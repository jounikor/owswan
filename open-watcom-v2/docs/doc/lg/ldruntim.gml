conventional memory required to be free after a program is loaded by
386|DOS-Extender.
Note that this memory is no longer available to the executing program.
The default value of

for the executing program.
The &lnkname truncates the specified value to a multiple of 16.
.sy n

(short form "CALLB") specifies the size of the call buffer allocated
for switching between 32-bit protected mode and real mode.
This buffer is used for communicating information between real-mode
and 32-bit protected-mode procedures.
The buffer address is obtained at run-time with a 386|DOS-Extender
system call.
The size returned is the size of the buffer in kilobytes and is less
than or equal to 64.
.np
The default buffer size is zero unless changed using the "CALLBUFS"
option.
The &lnkname truncates the specified value to a multiple of 1024.
.sy n
must be less than or equal to 64K.
Note that
.sy n
is the number of bytes, not kilobytes.

that is used when DOS and BIOS functions are called.
The size of this buffer is particularly important for file I/O.
If your program reads or writes large amounts of data, a large value
of
.sy n
should be specified.
.sy n
represents the number of bytes and must be less than or equal to 64K.
The default value of
.sy n
is 1K.
The &lnkname truncates the specified value to a multiple of 1024.

.sy n
represents the number of bytes and must be less than or equal to 64K.
The default value of
.sy n
is 4K.
The &lnkname truncates the specified value to a multiple of 1024.

The "RUNTIME" directive specifies the Application Binary Interface (ABI)
type and version under which the application will run.
The format of the "RUNTIME" directive (short form "RU") is as follows.

Specifying ABI/OS type and optional version indicates specific ABI that an
ELF application is written for. This information may affect how the ELF
executable will be interpreted by the operating system. If ABI version is
not specified, zero will be used. A list of official ABI types may be found
in the System V Application Binary Interface specification.

For example, both of the following example indicate that the application
requires Linux, but does not specify ABI version (numeric value zero).
