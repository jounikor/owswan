file.
.note Unable to create output file '%s'

specified output file is not marked "read-only".

The symbol file could not be created.
.note Error reading '%s'
An error occurred while reading the input executable file.
.note Error writing to '%s'
An error occurred while writing the output executable file or
the symbol file.
Check the amount of free space on the output disk.
If the input and output files reside on the same disk, there might
not be enough room for a second copy of the executable file during
processing.
.note Cannot erase file '%s'
The input executable file is probably marked "read-only" and
therefore could not be erased (the input file is erased whenever
the output file has the same name).
.note Cannot rename file '%s'
