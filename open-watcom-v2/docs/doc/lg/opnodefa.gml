Special object module records that specify default libraries are
placed in object files generated by &company compilers.
These libraries reflect the memory and floating-point model that a
source file was compiled for and are automatically searched by the
&lnkname when unresolved symbols are detected.
These libraries can exist in the current directory, in one of the
paths specified in "LIBPATH" directives, or in one of the paths
specified in the
.ev LIB
environment variable.

Note that all library files that appear in a "LIBRARY" directive are
searched before default libraries.
The "NODEFAULTLIBS" option instructs the &lnkname to ignore default
libraries.
That is, only libraries appearing in a "LIBRARY" directive are
searched.

The format of the "NODEFAULTLIBS" option (short form "NOD") is as
follows.
