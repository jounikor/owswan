.errnote 2002 ** internal ** - %s
.np
If this message occurs, you have found a bug in the linker and should
report it.
.*
.errnote 2008 cannot open %s1 : %s2
.np
An error occurred while trying to open the file "%s1".
The reason for the error is given by "%s2".
Generally this error message is issued when the linker cannot open a
file (e.g., an object file or an executable file).
.*
.errnote 3009 dynamic memory exhausted
.np
The linker uses all available memory when linking an application.
.if '&target' ne 'QNX' .do begin
For DOS-hosted versions of the linker, this includes expanded memory
(EMS) and extended memory.
.do end
When all available memory is used, a spill file will be used.
Therefore, unless you are low on disk space, the linker will always
be able to generate the executable file.
.if &e'&optdoc eq 0 .do begin
Dynamic memory is the memory the linker uses to build its internal
data structures and symbol table.
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
A spill file is not used for dynamic memory.
.do end
.el .do begin
:CMT. Dynamic memory is the amount of conventional memory (below 1 megabyte)
:CMT. available on your machine;
:CMT. a spill file is not used for dynamic memory.
Dynamic memory is the amount of unallocated memory available on your
machine (including virtual memory for those operating systems that
support it).
A spill file is not used for dynamic memory.
.do end
If the linker issues this message, it cannot link your application.
The following are suggestions that may help you in this situation.
.autonote
.note
Concatenate all your object files into one and specify only the
resulting object file as input to the linker.
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
For example, you can issue the following command.
.millust begin
% cat *.obj > all.tmp
% mv all.tmp all.obj
.millust end
.do end
.el .do begin
For example, if you are linking in a (Z)DOS environment, you can issue
the following DOS command.
.millust begin
C>copy/b *.obj all.obj
.millust end
.do end
.pc
This technique only works for OMF-type object files.
This significantly reduces the size of the file list the linker must
maintain.
.note
Object files may contain a record which specifies the module name.
This information is used by &dbgname to locate modules during a
debugging session and usually contains the full path of the source
file.
This can consume a significant amount of memory when many such object
files are being linked.
If your source is being compiled by the &cmpcname or C++ compiler, you
can use the "nm" option to set the module name to just the file name.
This reduces the amount of memory required by the linker.
If your are using &dbgname to debug your application, you may have to
use the "set source" command so that the source corresponding to a
module can be located.
.note
Typically, when you are compiling a program for a large code model,
each module defines a different "text" segment.
If you are compiling your application using the &cmpcname or C++
compiler, you can reduce the number of "text" segments that the linker
has to process by specifying the "nt" option.
The "nt" option allows you to specify the name of the "text" segment
so that a group of object files define the same "text" segment.
.endnote
.do end
.*
.errnote 2010,3010 I/O error processing %s1 : %s2
.np
An error has occurred while processing the file "%s1".
The cause of the error is given by "%s2".
This error is usually detected while reading from object and library
files or writing to the spill file or executable file.
For example, this error would be issued if a "disk full" condition
existed.
.*
.errnote 2011 invalid object file attribute
.np
The linker encountered an object file that was not of the format
required of an object file.
.*
.errnote 2012 invalid library file attribute
.np
The linker encountered a library file that was not of the format
required of a library file.
.*
.errnote 3013 break key detected
.np
The linking process was interrupted by the user from the keyboard.
.*
.errnote 1014 stack segment not found
.np
The linker identifies the stack segment by a segment defined as having
the "STACK" attribute.
This message is issued if no such segment is encountered.
This usually happens if the linker cannot find the run-time libraries
required to link your application.
.*
.errnote 2015 bad relocation type specified
.np
This message is issued if a a relocation is found in an object file
which the linker does not support.
.*
.errnote 2016 %a: absolute target invalid for self-relative relocation
.np
This message is issued, for example, if a near call or jump is made to
an external symbol which is defined using the "EQU" assembler
directive.
"%a" identifies the location of the near call or jump instruction.
.*
.errnote 2017 bad location specified for self-relative relocation at %a
.np
This message is issued if a bad fixup is encountered.
"%a" defines the location of the fixup.
.*
.errnote 2018 relocation offset at %a is out of range
.np
This message is issued when the offset part of a relocation exceeds
64K in a 16-bit executable or an Alpha executable.
"%a" defines the location of the fixup.
The error is most commonly caused by errors in coding assembly
language routines.
Consider a module that references an external symbol that is defined
in a segment different from the one in which the reference occurred.
The module, however, specifies that the segment in which the symbol is
defined is the same segment as the segment that references the symbol.
This error is most commonly caused when the "EXTRN" assembler
directive is placed after the "SEGMENT" assembler directive for the
segment referencing the symbol.
If the segment that references the symbol is allocated far enough away
from the segment that defines the symbol, the linker will issue this
message.
.if &e'&optdoc ne 0 .do begin
.np
This message should not be issued for a &powerpp Win32 executable.
If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end
.*
.errnote 1019 segment relocation at %a
.np
This message is issued when a 16-bit segment relocation is encountered
and "FORMAT DOS COM", "FORMAT PHARLAP" or "FORMAT NOVELL" has been
specified.
None of the above executable file formats allow segment relocation.
"%a" identifies the location of the segment relocation.
.if &e'&optdoc ne 0 .do begin
.np
This message should not be issued for a &powerpp Win32 executable.
If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end
.*
.errnote 2020 size of group %s exceeds 64k by %l bytes
.np
The group "%s" has exceeded the maximum size (64K) allowed for a group
in a 16-bit executable by "%l" bytes.
Usually, the group is "DGROUP" (the default data segment) and your
application has placed too much data in this group.
.if &e'&optdoc eq 0 .do begin
One of the following may solve this problem.
.autonote
.note
If you are using the &cmpcname or C++ compiler, you can place some of
your data in a far segment by using the "far" keyword when defining
data.
You can also decrease the value of the data threshold by using the
"zt" compiler option.
Any datum whose size exceeds the value of the data threshold will be
placed in a far segment.
.note
If you are using the &cmpfname compiler,
you can decrease the value of the data threshold by using the "dt"
compiler option.
Any datum whose size exceeds the value of the data threshold will be
placed in a far segment.
.endnote
.do end
.if &e'&optdoc ne 0 .do begin
.np
This message should not be issued for a &powerpp Win32 executable.
If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end
.*
.errnote 2021 size of segment %s exceeds 64k by %l bytes
.np
The segment "%s" has exceeded the maximum size (64K) for a segment in
a 16-bit executable.
This usually occurs if you are linking a 16-bit application that has
been compiled for a small code model and the size of the application
has grown in such a way that the size of the code segment ("_TEXT")
has exceeded 64K.
.if '&overlay' eq 'yes' .do begin
You can overlay your application or compile it for a large code model
.do end
.el .do begin
You can compile your application for a large code model
.do end

If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end
.*
.errnote 2022 cannot have a starting address with an imported symbol
.np
When generating an OS/2 executable file, a symbol imported from a DLL
cannot be a start address.
When generating a NetWare executable file, a symbol imported from
an NLM cannot be a start address.
.if &e'&optdoc ne 0 .do begin
.np
This message should not be issued for a &powerpp Win32 executable.
If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end
.*
.errnote 1023 no starting address found, using %a
.np
The starting address defines the location where execution is to begin
and must be defined by a special "module end" record in one of the
object files linked into your application.
This message is issued if no such record is encountered in which case
a default starting address, namely "%a", will be used.
This usually happens if the linker cannot find the run-time libraries
required to link your application.
.*
.if '&overlay' eq 'yes' .do begin
.errnote 2024 missing overlay loader
.np
This message is issued when an overlayed 16-bit DOS executable is
being linked and the overlay manager has not been encountered.
This usually happens if the linker cannot find the run-time libraries
required to link your application.
.if &e'&optdoc ne 0 .do begin
.np
This message should not be issued for a &powerpp Win32 executable.
If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end
.do end
.*
.if '&overlay' eq 'yes' .do begin
.errnote 2025 short vector %d is out of range
.np
This message is issued when the linker is creating an overlayed 16-bit
DOS executable and "OPTION SMALL" is specified.
Since an overlay vector contains a near call to the overlay loader
followed by a near jump to the routine corresponding to the overlay
vector, all code including the overlay manager and all overlay vectors
must be less than 64K.
This message is issued if the offset of an overlay vector from the
overlay loader or the corresponding routine exceeds 64K.
.if &e'&optdoc ne 0 .do begin
.np
This message should not be issued for a &powerpp Win32 executable.
If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end

.*
.errnote 2026 redefinition of reserved symbol %s
.np
The linker defines certain reserved symbols.
These symbols are "_edata", "_end", "__OVLTAB__", "__OVLSTARTVEC__",
"__OVLENDVEC__", "__LOVLLDR__", "__NOVLLDR__", "__SOVLLDR__",
"__LOVLINIT__", "__NOVLINIT__" and "__SOVLINIT__".
.if &e'&optdoc eq 0 .do begin
.if '&overlay' eq 'yes' .do begin
The symbols "__OVLTAB__", "__OVLSTARTVEC__", "__OVLENDVEC__",
"__LOVLLDR__", "__NOVLLDR__", "__SOVLLDR__", "__LOVLINIT__",
"__NOVLINIT__" and "__SOVLINIT__" are defined only if you are using
overlays in 16-bit DOS executables.
.do end
.do end
The symbols "_edata" and "_end" are defined only if the "DOSSEG"
option is specified.
Your application must not attempt to define these symbols.
"%s" identifies the reserved symbol.
.*
.errnote 1027 redefinition of %S ignored
.np
The symbol "%S" has been defined by more that one module; the first
definition is used.
This is only a warning message.
Note that if a symbol is defined more than once and its address is the
same in both cases, no warning will be issued.
.if &e'&optdoc eq 0 .do begin
This prevents the warning message from being issued when linking
FORTRAN 77 modules that contain common blocks.
.do end
.*
.errnote 1028,2028 %S is an undefined reference
.np
The symbol "%S" has been referenced but not defined.
Check that the spelling of the symbol is consistent.
.if &e'&optdoc eq 0 .do begin
If you wish the linker to ignore undefined references, use the
"UNDEFSOK" option.
.do end
.*
.errnote 2029 premature end of file encountered
.np
This error is issued while processing object files and object modules
from libraries and is caused if the end of the file or module is
reached before the "module end" record is encountered.
The probable cause is a truncated object file.
.*
.errnote 2030 multiple starting addresses found
.np
The starting address defines the location where execution is to begin
and is defined by a "module end" record in a particular object file.
This message is issued if more than one object file contains a "module
end" record that defines a starting address.
.*
.errnote 2031 segment %s is in group %s and group %s
.np
The segment "%s1" has been defined to be in group "%s2" in one module
and in group "%s3" in another module.
A segment can only belong to one group.
.*
.errnote 1032 record (type 0x%x) not processed
.np
An object record type not supported by the linker has been
encountered.
This message is issued when linking object modules created by other
compilers or assemblers that create object files with records that the
linker does not support.
.*
.errnote 2033,3033 directive error near '%s'
.np
A syntax error occurred while the linker was processing directives.
"%s" specifies where the error occurred.
.*
.errnote 2034 %a cannot have an offset with an imported symbol
.np
An imported symbol is one that was specified in an "IMPORT" directive.
Imported symbols are defined in Windows or OS/2 16-bit DLLs and in
Netware NLMs.
References to imported symbols must always have an offset value of 0.
If "DosWrite" is an imported symbol, then referencing "DosWrite+2" is
illegal.
"%a" defines the location of the illegal reference.
.if &e'&optdoc ne 0 .do begin
.np
This message should not be issued for a &powerpp Win32 executable.
If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end
.*
.errnote 1038 DEBUG directive appears after object files
.np
This message is issued if the first "DEBUG" directive appears after a
"FILE" directive.
A common error is to specify a "DEBUG" directive after the "FILE"
directives in which case no debugging information for those object
files is generated in the executable file.
.if &e'&optdoc ne 0 .do begin
.np
This message should not be issued when using &powerpp..
If it is issued, please report this problem.
.do end
.*
.errnote 2039 ALIGNMENT value too small
.np
The value specified in the "ALIGNMENT" option refers to the alignment
of segments in the executable file.
For 16-bit Windows or 16-bit OS/2, segments in the executable file are
pointed to by a segment table.
An entry in the segment table contains a 16-bit value which is a
multiple of the alignment value.
Together they form the offset of the segment from the start of the
segment table.
The smaller the alignment, the bigger the value required in the
segment table to point to the segment.
If this value exceeds 64K, then a larger alignment value is required
to decrease the size that goes in the segment table.

.errnote 1162 relocations on iterated data not supported
.np
An object file was encountered that contained an iterated data record
that requires relocation.
This is most commonly caused by a module coded in assembly language.
.*
.errnote 1163 module has not been compiled with the "zv" option
.np
When OPTION VFREMOVAL is used, all object files must be compiled with
the "zv" option.  The linker has detected an object file that has not
been compiled with this option.
.*
.errnote 3164 incremental linking does not support virtual function removal
.np
When OPTION INCREMENTAL is used, you cannot also specify OPTION
VFREMOVAL.

.errnote 2166 both %s1 and %s2 marked as starting symbols
.np
If the linker sees that there is more than one starting address
specified in the program and they have symbol names associated with
them, it will emit this error message. If there is more than one
starting address specified and at least one of them is unnamed, it
will issue message 2030.
.*
.errnote 1167 NLM internal name (%s) truncated
.np
This message is issued when generating a NetWare NLM.
The output file name as specified by the NAME directive has
specified a long file name (exceeds 8.3). The linker will truncate
the generated file name by using the first eight characters of the
specified file name and the first three characters of the file
extension (if supplied), separated by a period.
.*
.errnote 3168 exactly one export must exist for VxD format
.np
The Windows VxD format requires exactly one export to be present, but an
attempt was made to build a VxD module with no exports or more than one export.
.*
.errnote 2169 location counter already beyond fixed segment address %a
.np
When creating an image using the OUTPUT directive, a segment was specified
with an address lower than the current location counter. This would overlay
the segment data with already existing data at the same address, and is not
allowed.
.*
.errnote 1170 directive %s can only occur once
.np
A directive was specified more than once on the &lnkname. command line and
was ignored. Remove the redundant instances of the directive.
.*
.errnote 1171 locally defined symbol %s imported
.np
An imported symbol (intended to be imported from a DLL) was resolved locally.
The linker will ignore the symbol defined in a DLL, if provided, and the local
reference will be used. Ensure that this is the intended behaviour.
.*
.errnote 1172 stack size is less than %d bytes.
.np
The stack size for an executable specified through OPTION STACK is very small.
There is a high probability that the program will not work correctly. Consider
specifying a greater stack size.
.*
.errnote 3173 default data segment exceeds maximum size by %l bytes
.np
The default data segment size in a NE format executable (16-bit OS/2 or
Windows) exceeds the maximum allowed size. The default data segment includes
the data segment plus default stack size plus default heap size. The total
size must be 64K or less for OS/2 executables and 65,533 bytes or less for
Windows executables.
.*
.errnote 1174 IOPL bytes in EXPORT directive odd, ignoring low bit
.np
The EXPORT directive accepts the number of IOPL bytes, but the OS/2
executable formats, as well as the CPU, only work with the number of words.
If the specified number of IOPL bytes is an odd number, the lowest bit will
be ignored.
.*
.errnote 1175 symbol %s not found for tracing
.np
A "SYMTRACE" directive contained an symbol name (namely %s) that could not
be found.
