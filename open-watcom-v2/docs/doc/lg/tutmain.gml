.ix '&lnkcmdup' 'command line format'
.ix '&lnkcmdup command line' 'invoking &lnkcmdup'
.ix 'command line format' '&lnkcmdup'
.ix 'invoking &lnkname'
The &lnkname command line format is as follows.
.mbigbox
&lnkcmd {directive}
.embigbox
.np
where
.bi directive
is a series of &lnkname directives specified on the command line or in
one or more files.
If the directives are contained within a file, the "@" character is
used to reference that file.
If no file extension is specified, a file extension of "lnk" is
assumed.
.exam begin
&lnkcmd name testprog @first @second option map
.exam end
.np
In the above example, directives are specified on the command line
(e.g., "name testprog" and "option map") and in files (e.g.,
.fi first.lnk
and
.fi second.lnk
.ct ).

.section Using the SYSTEM Directive
.*
.np
.ix 'SYSTEM directive'
For each executable file format that can be created using the
&lnkname, a specific SYSTEM directive may be used.
The SYSTEM directive selects a subset of the available directives
necessary to create each specific executable file format.

The various systems that we have listed above are defined in special
linker directive files which are plain ASCII text files that you can
edit.
These files are called :FNAME.wlink.lnk:eFNAME.

In the following sections, we show some of the typical directives that
you might use to create a particular executable file format.
The common directives are described in the chapter
entitled :HDREF refid='genchap'..
They are "common" in the sense that they may be used with any
executable format.
There are other, less general, directives that may be specified for a
particular executable format.
In each of the following sections, we refer you to chapters in which
you will find more information on the directives available with the
executable format used.
.np
At this point, it should be noted that various systems have adopted
particular executable file formats. For example, the CauseWay DOS extender,
Tenberry Software DOS/4G(W) and FlashTek DOS extenders all
support one of the OS/2 executable file
formats. It is for this reason that you may find that we direct you to
a chapter which would, at first glance, seem unrelated to the
executable file format in which you are interested.
.np
To summarize, the steps that you should follow to learn about creating
a particular executable are:
.autonote
.note
Look for a section in this chapter that describes the executable
format in which you are interested.

See the chapter entitled :HDREF refid='genchap'. for a description of
the common directives.

If you require additional information, see also the chapter to which
we have referred you.
