.np
.ix 'video memory'
Many programmers require access to video RAM in order to directly
manipulate data on the screen.
Under DOS, it was standard practice to use a far pointer, with the
segment part of the far pointer set to the screen segment.
Under DOS extenders, this practice is not so standard.
Each DOS extender provides its own method for accessing video memory.
.if '&lang' eq 'FORTRAN 77' .do begin
The following program demonstrates the method used with DOS/4GW.
.code begin
* FSCREEN.FOR
* The following program shows how to access screen memory
* from a FORTRAN program under the DOS/4GW DOS extender.

* Compile & Link: wfl386 -l=dos4g fscreen

      program screen

* Allocatable arrays must be declared by specifying their
* dimensions using colons only (see &company FORTRAN 77
* Language Reference on the ALLOCATE statement for details).

      integer SCRSIZE, i

      parameter ( SCRSIZE = 80*25 )
.code break

* Under DOS/4GW, the first megabyte of physical memory - the
* real memory - is mapped as a shared linear address space.
* This allows your application to access video RAM using its
* linear address.  The DOS segment:offset of B800:0000
* corresponds to a linear address of B8000.

      allocate( screen(0:1,0:SCRSIZE-1), location='B8000'x )

      do i = 0, SCRSIZE - 1
          screen(0,i) = '*'

segment selector 0x1C.
This allows far pointer access to video RAM from a 32-bit program.
The following example illustrates this technique.

.section  How do I issue interrupts in a DOS/4GW application?
.*
.np
.ix 'interrupts' 'using DOS/4GW'
The &cmpname library files contain the FINTR and the FINTRF subroutines
which allows the user to perform interrupt calls within a &lang program.
This subroutine is described in the Subprogram Library section of the
.book &product User's Guide.
.np
The following sample program illustrates the use of the FINTR subroutine
to set up the register information required for Interrupt 21h.
The register information is loaded into the regs structure.  This structure
is defined in the DOS.FI file located in the \WATCOM\SRC\FORTRAN\DOS
directory.  Assign values to the register elements according to the
interrupt call requirements.  For example, Interrupt 21h, function 4Eh
needs valid values for the AH, ECX, DS and EDX to set up the registers
for the Interrupt 21h call.  This procedure can be used to perform
any interrupt calls that are supported in protected mode by DOS/4GW.
.*
.code begin
* DTA.FOR
* This program demonstrates the use of the FINTR
* function to list the files of the current directory.
* Interrupt 21 Functions for FIND FIRST, FIND NEXT,
* and GET DTA are used.

* Compile & Link: set finclude=\watcom\src\fortran\dos
*                 wfl386 -l=dos4g dta

        integer*1 dta(:)
        character fname*1(12), fname2*12
        equivalence (fname, fname2)
.code break

* DTA is declared as a FAR array.  When referencing an array
* element, the pointer to the array is a FAR pointer.  With a
* character variable, the result is a pointer to a string
* control block (SCB).  The run-time library expects the SCB
* to contain a near pointer.  To get around the problem, we
* define the DTA as a byte array, then use the CHAR function
* to get the character equivalent for printing a filename.

.section How do I get information about free memory in the 32-bit environment?
.*
.np
.ix 'free memory'
Under a virtual memory system, programmers are often interested
in the amount of physical memory they can allocate.
Information about the amount of free memory that is available is always
provided under a DPMI host, however,
the manner in which this information is provided may differ
under various environments.
Keep in mind that in a multi-tasking environment, the information
returned to your task from the DPMI host can easily become obsolete
if other tasks allocate memory independently of your task.
.if '&lang' eq 'FORTRAN 77' .do begin
.np
DOS/4GW provides a DPMI interface through interrupt 0x31.
This allows you to use DPMI service 0x0500 to get free memory
information.
The following program illustrates this procedure.
.code begin
* FMEMORY.FOR
* This example shows how to get information about free
* memory using DPMI call 0500h under DOS/4GW using &company

Many programmers require access to the first megabyte of memory in
order to look at key low memory addresses.
Under DOS, it was standard practice to use a far pointer, with the far

inspected.
Under DOS extenders, this practice is not so standard.

.ix 'spawn'
Sometimes applications need to spawn other programs as part of their
execution.
In the extended DOS environment, spawning tasks is much the same as
under DOS, however it should be noted that the only mode supported is
P_WAIT.
The P_OVERLAY mode is not supported since the DOS extender cannot be
removed from memory by the application (this is also the reason why
the exec() functions are unsupported).
The other modes are for concurrent operating systems only.
.np
Also, unless the application being spawned is bound or stubbed, the
DOS extender must be spawned with the application and its arguments
passed in the parameter list.

.section How Can I Use the Mouse Interrupt (0x33) with DOS/4GW?
.*
.np
.ix 'INT 33H' 'using DOS/4GW'
.ix 'mouse interrupt' 'using DOS/4GW'
Several commonly used interrupts are automatically supported in
protected mode with DOS/4GW.
The DOS extender handles the switch from protected mode to real mode
and manages any intermediate real-mode data buffers that are required.
To use a supported interrupt, set up the register information as
required for the interrupt and use one of the int386() or int386x()
library functions to execute the interrupt.
For calls that are not supported by DOS/4GW, you can use the DPMI
function, Simulate a Real-Mode Interrupt (0x0300).
This process is described in the next section.
.np
Since the mouse interrupt (0x33) is quite commonly used, DOS/4GW
provides protected-mode support for the interrupt and any mouse data
buffer that is required.
The following example demonstrates how a programmer could use the
Microsoft standard mouse interrupt (0x33) from within a DOS/4GW
application.

.section How Do I Simulate a Real-Mode Interrupt with DOS/4GW?
.*
.np
.ix 'interrupts' 'real-mode simulation'
.ix 'simulating real-mode interrupts'
Some interrupts are not supported in protected mode with DOS/4GW but
they can still be called using the DPMI function, Simulate Real-Mode
Interrupt (0x0300).
Information that needs to be passed down to the real-mode interrupt is
transferred using an information data structure that is allocated in
the protected-mode application.
The address to this protected-mode structure is passed into DPMI
function 0x0300.
DOS/4GW will then use this information to set up the real-mode
registers, switch to real mode and then execute the interrupt in real
mode.
.np
If your protected-mode application needs to pass data down into the
real-mode interrupt, an intermediate real-mode buffer must be used.
This buffer can be created using DPMI function 0x0100 to allocate
real-mode memory.
You can then transfer data from the protected-mode memory to the
real-mode memory using a far pointer as illustrated in the
"SIMULATE.C" example.
.np
The following example illustrates how to allocate some real-mode
memory, transfer a string of characters from protected mode into the
real-mode buffer, then set up and call the Interrupt 0x0021 function
to create a directory.
The string of characters are used to provide the directory name.
This example can be adapted to handle most real-mode interrupt calls
that aren't supported in protected mode.

.section How do you install a bi-modal interrupt handler using DOS/4GW?
.*
.np
.ix 'DOS/4GW' 'bi-modal interrupt'
.ix 'bi-modal interrupt'
Due to the nature of the protected-mode/real-mode interface, it is often
difficult to handle high speed communications with hardware interrupt
handlers.
For example, if you install your communications interrupt handler in
protected mode, you may find that some data is lost when transmitting
data from a remote machine at the rate of 9600 baud.
This occurs because the data arrived at the communication port while the
machine was in the process of transferring the previous interrupt up to
protected mode.
Data will also be lost if you install the interrupt handler in real mode
since your program, running in protected mode, will have to switch down
into real mode to handle the interrupt.
The reason for this is that the data arrived at the communication port
while the DOS extender was switching between real mode and protected
mode, and the machine was not available to process the interrupt.
.np
To avoid the delay caused by switching between real-mode and protected
mode to handle hardware interrupts, install interrupt handlers in both
real-mode and protected-mode.
During the execution of a protected-mode program, the system often
switches down into real-mode for DOS system calls.
If a communications interrupt occurs while the machine is in real-mode,
then the real-mode interrupt handler will be used.
If the interrupt occurs when the machine is executing in protected-mode,
then the protected-mode interrupt handler will be used.
This enables the machine to process the hardware interrupts faster and
avoid the loss of data caused by context switching.
.np
Installing the interrupt handlers in both protected-mode and real-mode
is called bi-modal interrupt handling.
The following program is an example of how to install both handlers for
Interrupt 0x0C (also known as COM1 or IRQ4).
The program writes either a 'P' to absolute address 0xB8002 or an 'R' to
absolute address 0xB8000.
These locations are the first two character positions in screen memory
for a color display.
As the program runs, you can determine which interrupt is handling the
COM1 port by the letter that is displayed.
A mouse attached to COM1 makes a suitable demo.
Type on the keyboard as you move the mouse around.
The ESC key can be used to terminate the program.
Transmitted data from a remote machine at 9600 baud can also be used to
test the COM1 handling.

You will also need to create the following assembler code module.
The first part provides the interrupt handling routine for the
real-mode interrupt handler.
The second provides the protected-mode version of the interrupt
handler.
