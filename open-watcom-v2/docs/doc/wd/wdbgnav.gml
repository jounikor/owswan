you must enter the search string that you are looking
for and set the parameters for the search.
The Search screen consists of the following items:
.begnote $break
.note Enter Search String
Enter the string to be found in this edit box. The larger list below
shows other strings that you have searched for during this
debugging session. You can select these by clicking on them or by
using the up and down arrow keys.
The most recent search string appears at the top of the list.
.note Regular Expression
Check this box if the string is to be interpreted as a regular expression.
You can click on the Edit button to edit the set of regular expression
characters that will be used. For a description of regular expressions,
see the Editor manual.

.section *refid=wndsrc The Source Window
.*
.figure *depth='2.80' *scale=70 *file='dbgsrc' The Source Window
.np
The
.wnddef Source
window displays your program's source code.  As you trace through
your program, it repositions itself at the currently execution location.
If you have an Assembly window open, the Source and Assembly windows will
always be positioned at the same code.  If you scroll in one, the other
follows.
.np
Source lines that have code associated with them have a button at the
left of the screen. You can click on this button to set, disable and
clear break points.
.np
You can Inspect any item displayed in the source window by
double-clicking on it, or by cursoring to it and pressing ENTER.
Press the right mouse button to access the following pop-up menu items:
.begmenu Source Pop-up
.menuitem Inspect
.ix 'variables' 'inspecting'
.ix 'functions' 'inspecting'
Inspect the selected item in an appropriate window.
You can select function names, variable
names, or any valid expression.
.menuitem Run to Cursor
Resume program execution until the selected line is executed.
.menuitem Break
.ix 'variables' 'break on write'
.ix 'breakpoint' 'on write'
Add a breakpoint based on the selected text.
If a variable is selected, the program will
stop when its value changes. If a function name is selected the program will
stop when that function is executed.
.bi This does not set a break at the current line.
Use
.menuref 'Toggle' 'Break'
or
.menuref 'At Cursor' 'Break'
to set a breakpoint at the current line.
.menuitem Enter Function
.ix 'run' 'until function entered'
Resume program execution until the selected function is entered.
.menuitem Watch
.ix 'expressions' 'evaluating'
.ix 'expressions' 'watching'
Add the selected item to the Watches window for further inspection
or modification.
.menuitem Find

any expression that resolves to a code address.
For example, you might
type the name of a variable that contains a pointer to a function.
.refalso videxpr
.menuitem Show/Module
.ix 'source code' 'examining a module'
Show the code for a different module. You will be prompted for its

Three items are displayed for each module.  At the left, there is
a button.  You can click the mouse on it to see the source or
assembly associated with the module.  This can also be
accomplished by double-clicking on the module name or cursoring to
it and pressing ENTER.  Next is the module name. Third, if the
module is contained in an executable image other than the one
being debugged, is the name of that image.
.np
Since this window is sorted
.menuref 'Match' 'Search'
can be used to find a module.  Choose
.menuref 'Match' 'Search'
(or press =) and begin
typing the name of the module.

.ix 'images' 'showing list of'
Choose
.menuref 'Images' 'Code'
to open the
.wnddef Images
window.  It displays a list of executable images
associated with the program that you are currently debugging.
Executable images include the program executable, DLLs (Windows,
OS/2 and Windows NT), and NLMs (NetWare). This window
displays the name of the executable image, the name of the symbolic
debugging information file (if available), and the debugging
information type.
.np
Different debugging information types are generated by different compilers.
.np
.ix 'debugging information'
Valid information types are:
.begnote $break
.note DWARF
This information is generated by the &company compilers.
.note Watcom
This information is optionally generated by the &company compilers.
.note CodeView
In addition to &company compilers, several other products, including
Microsoft's, can generate CodeView style information.
.note MAPSYM
This information is generated by Microsoft's or IBM's MAPSYM utility.
MAPSYM processes linker map file and outputs a .sym file. Symbol files
in MAPSYM format are often available for OS/2 system DLLs. MAPSYM files
only contain information about global symbols, but usually provide much
more detail than just exports information.
.note EXPORTS
This information is contained in the executable file itself, and is
used by the operating system.  Under OS/2, Windows and Windows NT,  DLLs
have export tables which define the names and addresses of entry points.
Exports information lets
you see the names of system entry points and APIs.
Novell NLMs also have entry point tables.  In addition, they may
have Novell style debugging information, created with Novell's
linker (NLMLINK) or using the &company Linker's "debug novell" option.
This information is made available to the debugger.
.endnote
.np
You can add new debugging information to an image by double-clicking
on the image name or cursoring to it and pressing ENTER.
.np
Press the right mouse button to access the following pop-up menu items:
.begmenu Images Pop-up
.menuitem New Symbols
Add symbolic debugging information
for the selected image.  This is useful if you know that a separate debug
information file contains the appropriate debugging information that
was not found by the debugger.
.menuitem Delete Symbols
Delete any symbolic debugging information associated with
the selected image.
.menuitem Modules
Show a list of modules contained in the selected image.
.menuitem Functions
Show a list of functions contained in the selected image.
.menuitem Globals
Show a list of all global variables contained in the selected image.
