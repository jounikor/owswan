.ix 'Symbols...'
In the dialog, you can click the Symbols... button as a shortcut.
You can type a partial symbol
name like
.id foo
and the Symbol button will show you a list of symbols that start with
.id foo.
You can then choose one of these symbols by clicking on it or
hitting ENTER.  Note that the first time you use the Symbols...  in
a debugging session, it will take a while as the debugger sorts
the symbol table for the program.
