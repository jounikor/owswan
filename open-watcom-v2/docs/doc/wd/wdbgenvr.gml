.*
.menuitem Command
.*
Enter a debugger command. For a description of debugger commands,
refer to the section entitled :HDREF refid='vidcmd'..
.*
.menuitem Options
.*
.ix 'options' 'setting'
.ix 'settings'
Set the global debugging options. For a full description of these
options, refer to the section entitled :HDREF refid='dlgopt'..
.*
.menuitem Window Options
.*
Set the options for the debugger's various windows. For a full
description of these options, refer to the section entitled
:HDREF refid='dlgwopt'..
.*
.menuitem Save Setup
.*
Save the debugger's current configuration. This saves the positions
and sizes of all windows as well as all options and settings. By
default, this information is saved into the file
.fi setup.dbg
.ct , however, you can save this information into another file to
create alternate debugger configurations.
.*
.menuitem Load Setup
.*
Load a configuration previously saved using
.mi Save Setup.
.*
.menuitem Source Path
.*
.ix 'source' 'locating files'
Modify the list of directories which will be searched when the debugger
is searching for source files.

.section *refid=dlgopt The Options Dialog
.*
.ix 'options' 'dialog'
.figure *depth='3.0' *scale=60 *file='dlgopt' The Options Dialog
.np
The Options
dialog allows you to change the following settings:
.begnote
.ix 'configuration' 'automatic saving of'
.ix 'configuration' 'saving'
.ix 'settings' 'automatic saving of'
.ix 'settings' 'saving'
.note Auto configuration save
When this option is on, the debugger automatically saves its configuration
upon exit.
.ix 'Bell'
.ix 'option' 'Bell'
.note Warning Bell
When this option is on, the debugger will beep when a warning or error
is issued.
.ix 'invoke files'
.note Implicit Invoke
If this option is on, the debugger will treat an unknown command as
the name of a command file and automatically try to invoke it. If this
option is off, you must use the invoke command to invoke a command
file.
.np
Under UNIX, a conflict is possible when Invoke is on. A path specified
for a command file name is confused with the short form of the DO
command (/). A similar problem occurs under DOS, OS/2, Windows 3.x,
Windows NT, or Windows 95 when a drive specifier forms part of the
file name.
.ix 'Recursive functions' 'tracing over'
.ix 'Trace Over' 'recursive functions'
.note Recursion Check
Use this option to control the way tracing over recursive function
calls is handled. When this option is on, and you trace over a
function call, the debugger will not stop if the function executes
recursively.
.ix 'Break on write'
.ix 'option' 'Break on write'
.note Break on write (not change)
Use this option (if available with the selected trap) to enable true
break-on-write breakpoints. This will break on any write access; not just
when a watch point has changed.
.note Screen flip on execution
Use this option to control whether the debugger automatically flips the
display to the application's screen upon execution.
.bi Leave this option on if you are using the character mode debugger
.bi to debug a Windows 3.x application.
.note Ignore case
.ix 'search' 'ignoring case'
.ix 'case insensitive searching'
This option controls whether or not case is ignored or respected when
the debugger is searching for a string.
.note Do not expand hex numbers
This option controls whether or not hexadecimal values are displayed in
their natural size (zero preceded) or displayed in their most compact form.
The default is to display the value in its full natural size.
.ix 'Radix' 'default'
.ix 'Radix' 'setting'
.note Default Radix
Use this option to define the default radix used by the debugger. The
debugger associates a radix with each action automatically. For
example, if you are asked to enter an address, the debugger assumes
base 16. If you double click on a decimal value, you will be prompted
for a decimal replacement value but there are occasions when the
debugger must use the default radix. If you add an arbitrary
expression to the Watches window, the default radix is used when
interpreting that expression. You can specify any radix between 2 and
36.
.note Double click mS
This option sets the amount of time in milliseconds allowed between two clicks
for the debugger to accept it as a double click.  Enter a larger value
if you are having trouble with double clicks.
