Structures may be composed of simple FORTRAN types or more complex
structure types.
This is shown in the following example.
.exam begin
      STRUCTURE /ADDRESS/
          CHARACTER*20 STREET
          CHARACTER*20 CITY
          CHARACTER*20 STATE
          CHARACTER*20 COUNTRY
          CHARACTER*10 ZIP_CODE
      END STRUCTURE

      STRUCTURE /PEOPLE/
          CHARACTER*20 NAME
          RECORD /ADDRESS/ ADDR
          INTEGER*2 AGE

      RECORD /PEOPLE/ CUSTOMER

Element names are local to the structure in which they appear.
The same element name can appear in more than one structure.
Nested structures may have elements with the same name.
A particular element is specified by listing the sequence of
elements required to reach the desired element, separated by
percent symbols (%) or periods (.).
.exam begin
      CUSTOMER%NAME = 'John Doe'
      CUSTOMER%ADDR%STREET = '22 Main St.'
      CUSTOMER%ADDR%CITY = 'Smallville'
      CUSTOMER%ADDR%STATE = 'Texas'
      CUSTOMER%ADDR%COUNTRY = 'U.S.A.'
      CUSTOMER%ADDR%ZIP_CODE = '78910-1203'
      CUSTOMER%AGE = 23
