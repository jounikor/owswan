is a variable name or an array name.

The
.kw VOLATILE
statement is used to indicate that a variable or an element of an
array may be updated concurrently by other code.
A volatile variable or array element will not be cached (in a
register) by the code generator.
Each time a volatile variable or array element is referenced, it is
loaded from memory.
Each time a volatile variable or array element is updated, it is
stored back into memory.
.autonote Notes:
.setptnt 0 5
.note
A name cannot appear in a
.kw VOLATILE
statement more than once in the same program unit.
.note
Dummy arguments, procedure names, and common block names are not
permitted in a
.kw VOLATILE
statement.
.endnote
.np
In the following example, the subroutine
.id A_THREAD
waits on the
.id HoldThreads
semaphore.
It uses the
.kw VOLATILE
statement to ensure that the variable is re-loaded from memory each
time through the loop.
