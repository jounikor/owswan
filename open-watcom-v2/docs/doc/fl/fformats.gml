.np
A
.us format
specification used in conjunction with formatted I/O provides a
means of specifying the way internal data is converted to a
character string and vice versa.
A format specification can be given in two ways.
.autopoint
.point
In a
.kw FORMAT
statement.
.point
As values of character expressions or character arrays.
.endpoint
.*
.section The FORMAT Statement
.*
.np
The form of a
.kw FORMAT
statement is
.mbox begin
      label    FORMAT fs
.mbox end
.synote 7
.mnote label
is the statement label used by an I/O statement to identify the
.kw FORMAT
statement.
.mnote fs
is a format specification which will be described later.
.esynote
.exam begin
      REAL X
      X = 234.43
      PRINT 100, X
100   FORMAT(F10.2)
      END
.exam end
.pc
In the previous example, the
.kw PRINT
statement uses the format specification in the
.kw FORMAT
statement whose statement label is 100 to display the value of
.id X
.period
.*
.section FORMAT as a Character Expression
.*
.np
Instead of specifying the statement label of a
.kw FORMAT
statement, a character expression can be used.
The previous example could be modified as follows and achieve the
identical result.
.exam begin
      REAL X
      X = 234.43
      PRINT '(F10.2)', X
      END
.exam end
.np
When using a character expression to represent a format specification,
the format specification can be preceded by blank characters and followed
by any character data without affecting the format specification.
The following example produces the identical result to the previous
example.
.exam begin
      REAL X
      X = 234.43
      PRINT '    (F10.2) THIS IS FOR X', X
      END
.exam end
.np
If a character array is used to describe the format specification,
the format specification is considered to be the concatenation of
all the character array elements in the order given by array element
ordering described in the chapter entitled :HDREF refid='farrays'..
Note that if a character array element is used, the format specification
is considered to be only that array element.
.exam begin
      REAL X
      CHARACTER*5 FMTSPEC(3)
      X = 234.43
      FMTSPEC(1)='('
      FMTSPEC(2)='F10.2'
      FMTSPEC(3)=')'
      PRINT FMTSPEC, X
      END

.ix 'format' 'see also' 'edit descriptor'
A
.us format specification
.ix 'format specification'
has the following form.
.mbox begin
      ( [flist] )
.mbox end
.synote 8
.mnote flist
is a list whose items are separated by commas.
The forms of the items in
.id flist
are:
.np
.id [r] ed
.np
.id ned
.np
.id [r] fs
.mnote ed
is a repeatable edit descriptor.
.mnote ned
is a nonrepeatable edit descriptor.
.mnote fs
is a format specification with a nonempty list
.id flist
.period
.mnote r
is a positive unsigned integer constant called a
.us repeat specification.
.ix 'format' 'repeat specification'
.esynote
.np
The comma separating the items of
.id flist
can be omitted in the following cases.
.autopoint
.point
Between a
.id P
edit descriptor and an
.id F
.ct ,
.id E
.ct ,
.id D
or
.id G
edit descriptor which immediately follows.
.point
Before or after a slash edit descriptor.
.point
Before or after a colon edit descriptor.
.endpoint
.np
.xt begin
&product allows the omission of a comma between the items of
.id flist
.period
Care should be taken when omitting commas between edit descriptors.
For example, the format specification
.mono (I5 2I3)
may appear to be an
.mono I5
edit descriptor followed by two
.mono I3
edit descriptors when in actuality it is interpreted as an
.mono I52
edit descriptor followed by an
.mono I3
edit descriptor.

.section Editing
.*
.np
Edit descriptors are used to describe the way the editing between
internal representation of data and the characters of a record in a file
is to take place.
When the edit descriptors
.id I
.ct ,
.id F
.ct ,
.id E
.ct ,
.id D
.ct ,
.id G
.ct ,
.id L
.ct ,
.id A
.ct ,
.id H
.ct ,
.id Z
or apostrophe are
processed, they process a sequence of characters called a
.us field.
.ix 'format' 'field'
On input, the field is the character data read from a record; on output
it is the character data written to a record.
The number of characters in a field is called the
.us field width.
.ix 'format' 'field width'
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section Apostrophe Editing
.*
.np
The
.us apostrophe edit descriptor
.ix 'apostrophe edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'apostrophe'
has the same form as a character constant
and can only be used on output.
It causes the characters in the format specification enclosed in quotes
to be written.
The field width is the number of characters enclosed in quotes.
.exam begin
      PRINT '(''HI THERE'')'
      END
.exam end
.pc
In the previous example, the string
.millust begin
HI THERE
.millust end
.pc
would be the output produced by the
.kw PRINT
statement.
.*
.section H Editing
.*
.np
The
.id nH
.ix 'H edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'H'
edit descriptor causes the
.id n
characters following the
.id H
.ct , including blanks, to be written.
Like the apostrophe edit descriptor, it can only appear in a format
specification used for output.
.exam begin
      PRINT '(8HHI THERE)'
      END
.exam end
.pc
In the previous example, the string
.millust begin
HI THERE
.millust end
.pc
would be the output produced by the
.kw PRINT
statement.

.section Positional Editing: T, TL, TR and X Editing
.*
.np
.ix 'positional edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'positional'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'positional T'

.ix 'edit descriptor' 'positional TR'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'positional X'
.ix 'T edit descriptor'
.ix 'TL edit descriptor'
.ix 'TR edit descriptor'
.ix 'X  edit descriptor'
The
.id T
.ct ,
.id TL
.ct ,
.id TR
and
.id X
edit descriptors specify at which position the next character will be
read from or written to the record.
In the case of input, this allows data to be read more than once with
different edit descriptors.
On output, it is possible to overwrite data previously written.
.np
On output it is possible to use positional editing to create a record
in which gaps appear.
That is, there may be parts of the record where no data has been
written.
The parts of a record in which no data has been written are filled with
blanks.
The effect is as if the record was previously initialized to blanks.
Note that positioning does not cause any data to be transmitted.
.np
The
.id Tc
edit descriptor specifies that the next character to be
transmitted is to be from the
.id c
.ct th
character position in the record.
The
.id TLc
edit descriptor specifies that the next character to be
transmitted is to be from the
.id c
.ct th
position backward from the current position.
The
.id TRc
edit descriptor is identical to the
.id TLc
edit descriptor except
that positioning is forward from the current position.
The
.id nX
edit descriptor behaves identically to the
.id TRc
edit descriptor;
the transmission of the next character is
.id n
character positions forward from the current position.
.xt on
If
.id n
is omitted then the transmission of the next character is 1 character
position forward from the current position.
.xt off
.exam begin
      PRINT '(''THE NUMBER       IS AN INTEGER'',TL19,
     $      ''12345'')'

The output produced is
.millust begin
THE NUMBER 12345 IS AN INTEGER
.millust end
.*
.section Slash Editing
.*
.np
The
.us slash edit descriptor
.ix 'slash edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'slash'
indicates the end of data transfer on the current record.
On input from a record connected for sequential access, the remaining
characters in the record are skipped and the file is positioned to the
start of the next record.
Note that entire records may be skipped.
On output, a new record is created and becomes the last and current
record of the file.
Note that a record with no characters can be written.
If the file is an internal file or a direct access file, the record
is filled with blanks.
.np
For a file connected for direct access, the current record number is
increased by one and the file is positioned at the beginning of that
record.
.*
.section Colon Editing
.*
.np
The
.us colon edit descriptor
.ix 'colon edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'colon'
terminates processing of the format
specification if there are no more items in the I/O list.
If there are items remaining in the I/O list, the colon edit
descriptor has no effect.
.*
.section S, SP and SS Editing
.*
.np
The
.id S
.ct ,
.id SP
and
.id SS
.ix 'S edit descriptor'
.ix 'SS edit descriptor'
.ix 'SP edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'S'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'SS'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'SP'
edit descriptors control optional plus characters in
numeric output fields.
They only effect the
.id I
.ct ,
.id F
.ct ,
.id E
.ct ,
.id D
and
.id G
edit descriptors during output
and have no effect on input.
The FORTRAN 77 standard specifies that before processing a format
specification, the appearance of a plus sign in numeric output fields
is optional and is determined by the processor.
&product does not produce plus signs in numeric output fields.
When an
.id SP
edit descriptor is encountered, a plus sign is produced
in any subsequent position that optionally contains a plus sign.
When as
.id SS
edit descriptor is encountered, a plus sign is not produced
in any subsequent position that optionally contains a plus sign.
If an
.id S
edit descriptor is encountered, the option is returned to the
processor.
.exam begin
      PRINT '(1H<,I5,SP,I5,SS,I5,1H>)',1,2,3

.kw PRINT
statement in the previous example is:
.millust begin

.*
.section P Editing
.*
.np
The form of a
.id P
edit descriptor is
.ix 'P edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'P'
.id kP
where
.id k
is an optionally signed integer constant called the
.us scale factor.
.ix 'scale factor'
The value of the scale factor is zero at the beginning of each I/O
statement.
The scale factor applies to all subsequent
.id F
.ct ,
.id E
.ct ,
.id D
and
.id G
edit descriptors until another scale factor is encountered.
The scale factor affects editing in the following way.
.autopoint
.point
On input with
.id F
.ct ,
.id E
.ct ,
.id D
and
.id G
editing, provided that no exponent exists
in the field, the effect is that the
represented number equals the internally represented number multiplied
by
.mono 10**k.
.point
On input with
.id F
.ct ,
.id E
.ct ,
.id D
and
.id G
editing, the scale factor has no effect
if there is an exponent in the field.
.point
On
.id F
output editing, the effect is that the represented number equals
the internally represented number multiplied
by
.mono 10**k.
.point
On output with
.id E
and
.id D
editing, the simple real constant
(see the chapter entitled :HDREF refid='ftypes'.)
part of the data is multiplied by
.id 10**k
and the exponent is reduced by
.id k
.period
.point
On output with
.id G
editing, the scale factor has no effect unless the
magnitude of the datum is outside the range that allows
.id F
editing (see the section entitled :HDREF refid='gedit'.).
If
.id E
editing is required, the scale factor has the same effect as
with
.id E
output editing.
.endpoint
.*
.section BN and BZ Editing

.np
The
.id BN
and
.id BZ
.ix 'BN edit descriptor'
.ix 'BZ edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'BN'
.ix 'edit descriptor' 'BZ'
edit descriptors are used to describe the interpretation
of embedded blanks in numeric input fields.
They only effect
.id I
.ct ,
.id F
.ct ,
.id E
.ct ,
.id D
and
.id G
editing and have no effect during output.
When a
.id BN
edit descriptor is encountered in a format specification,
embedded blanks in subsequent numeric input fields are ignored.
However, a field of all blanks has the value of zero.
If a
.id BZ
edit descriptor is encountered, then all embedded blanks
in subsequent numeric input fields are treated as zeroes.
At the beginning of each I/O statement, all blanks are treated as
zeroes or ignored depending on the value of the
.kw BLANK=
specifier
(see the
.kw OPEN
statement) currently in effect for the unit.
.*
.section $ or \ Editing (Extension)
.*
.np
.ix '$ edit descriptor'
.ix '\ edit descriptor'
.ix 'edit descriptor' '$'
.ix 'edit descriptor' '\'
.xt begin
The $ and \ edit descriptors behave identically.
The $ and \ edit descriptors are intended for output to an interactive
device such as a terminal.
They are a &product extensions.
The output record is displayed at the terminal leaving the cursor at
the end of the record; the carriage return at the end of the line is
suppressed.
Its use is intended for prompting for input so that the response can
be entered immediately following the prompt.
.xt end
.np
Depending on the type of terminal, the prompt may be returned as part
of the input.
An application must be aware of the way a particular terminal behaves.
The following example demonstrates this.
Note that the format specification in the
.kw FORMAT
statement labelled
.mono 20
ignores the first eleven characters of the
response since the prompt also appears in the response.
.exam begin
      INTEGER AGE
      WRITE(6,FMT=10)

      PRINT *,'Your age is ',AGE
      END
.exam end
.pc
If the terminal you are using does not return the prompt as part of the
response (that is, a read from the terminal only includes characters
typed at the terminal), the format specification in the
.kw FORMAT
statement labelled
.mono 20
must be changed, as in the following example, to achieve the same result.
.exam begin
      INTEGER AGE
      WRITE(6,FMT=10)
10    FORMAT( 'Enter age: ',\/ )

.section Numeric Editing: I, F, E, D and G Edit Descriptors
.*
.np
Numeric edit descriptors are used to specify I/O of integer, real,
double precision, complex and double precision complex data.
The following rules apply to all numeric edit descriptors.
.autopoint
.point
On input, leading blanks are not significant.
The interpretation of blanks other than leading blanks is determined
by any
.id BN
or
.id BZ
edit descriptors in effect and the
.kw BLANK=
specifier (see the
.kw OPEN
statement).
A field of all blanks is always zero.
Plus signs are optional.
.point
On input, with
.id F
.ct ,
.id E
.ct ,
.id D
and
.id G
editing, the decimal location specified
in the edit descriptor is overridden by a decimal point appearing
in the input field.
.point
On output, the plus sign is optional and is determined by the
.id S
.ct ,
.id SP
and
.id SS
edit descriptors.
A negative quantity is represented by a negative sign.
A minus sign is never produced when outputting a value of zero.
.point
On output, the representation is always right justified in the field
with leading blanks inserted at the beginning of the field if the
number of characters in the representation is less than the field width.
.point
On output, if the number of characters in the external representation
is greater than the field width or an exponent exceeds its specified
length using
.id Ew.dEe
.ct ,
.id Gw.dEe

The item in the I/O list must be of type integer; on input the
I/O list item will be defined by integer data, on output the I/O
list item must be defined with an integer datum.

more leading blanks followed by a minus sign if the value of the
I/O list item is negative or an optional plus sign otherwise,
followed by the magnitude of the integer datum with no leading zeroes.
Note that the integer constant contains at least one digit.
On output, the

In other words, the decimal point is assumed to lie to the left of the
8 digits (padded with zeroes on the left) forming the fractional part
of the input value.
.np
The output field produced by an

edit descriptor consists of blanks
if necessary followed by a minus sign if the item in the I/O list
is negative or an optional plus sign otherwise, followed by
a string of digits containing a decimal point which represents the
magnitude of the I/O list item.
The string representing the magnitude of the I/O list item is
modified according to the scale factor and is rounded to

.ix 'format-directed I/O'
.us Format-directed input/output
(I/O) is formatted input or output controlled by a format
specification.
The action taken during formatted input or output depends on the
next edit descriptor in the format specification and the next
item in the input/output list if one exists.
.np
A format specification is processed from left to right.
An edit descriptor or a format specification with a repeat specification
of
.id r
is processed as a list of
.id r
edit descriptors or format specifications.
A repeat specification of one is equivalent to no repeat specification.
.np
For each repeatable edit descriptor in the format specification, there
corresponds one item in the I/O list except an I/O list item of type
complex where two repeatable floating-point edit descriptors are
required.
Non-repeatable edit descriptors do not correspond to any I/O list
item; they communicate information directly with the record.
Whenever a repeatable edit descriptor is encountered in a format
specification, there must be a corresponding item in the I/O list.
The edited information is transmitted appropriately between
the item and the record.
.np
Format processing is terminated when any of the following conditions
occur.
.autopoint
.point
When an edit descriptor has no
corresponding item in the I/O list.
.point
When a colon edit descriptor is encountered and there are no more
items in the I/O list.
.point
When the right parenthesis is encountered and there are no more
items in the I/O list.
.endpoint
.np
If the right parenthesis of the complete format specification is
encountered and the I/O list has not been
exhausted, the file is positioned at the next record and
format processing resumes at the start of the format
specification terminated by the last preceding right parenthesis.
If there is no such right parenthesis, format processing resumes
at the start of the complete format specification.
The part of the format specification that is reused must contain
at least one repeatable edit descriptor.
If format processing resumes at a left parenthesis preceded by a repeat
specification, the repeat specification is also reused.
The scale factor, sign control edit descriptors and blank control
edit descriptors are not affected when part of a format specification
is reused.
