.section INQUIRE Statement
.*
.np
The
.kw INQUIRE
statement is used to ask about certain properties of a named file
or its connection to a particular unit.
There are two forms of the
.kw INQUIRE
statement; inquire by file name and inquire by unit.

.section INQUIRE by FILE

      INQUIRE (iflist)
.mbox end
.synote 8
.mnote iflist
includes the
.kw FILE=
specifier and may include at most one
of each of the inquiry specifiers listed below.
Specifiers are separated by commas.
The
.kw FILE=
specifier has the form
.millust FILE = fin
where
.id fin
is a character expression whose value when trailing blanks are
removed is the name of a file being inquired about.
The file need not exist or be connected to a unit.

.exam begin
      LOGICAL EX, OD
      INTEGER NUM
      INQUIRE( FILE='ROLL',EXIST=EX,OPENED=OD,NUMBER=NUM )
.exam end
.pc
In the above example, information is requested on the file
.mono PAYROLL.
In particular, we want to know if it exists, whether it is connected
to a unit, and what the unit number is (if it is indeed connected).

includes the
.kw UNIT=
specifier and may include at most one
of each of the inquiry specifiers listed below.
Specifiers are separated by commas.
The
.kw UNIT=
specified has the form
.millust [UNIT =] u
where
.id u
is an
.us external unit identifier.
An external unit identifier is a non-negative integer
expression.
If the optional
.kw UNIT=
specifier is omitted then the
specifier must be the first item in the list of specifiers.

In the above example, information is requested on unit 7.
In particular, we want to know if the unit exists, whether it is
connected to a file, and, if so, what the file name is.

if
.kw UNFORMATTED
is included in the set of
allowed forms for the file, the value
.mono 'NO'
if
.kw UNFORMATTED
is not included in the set of allowed forms for the file, or
.mono 'UNKNOWN'
if &product is unable to determine whether or not
.kw UNFORMATTED
is included in the set of allowed forms for the file.
.note RECL = rcl
.id rcl
is an integer variable or integer array element that is assigned
the value of the record length of the file connected for direct
access.
If the file is connected for formatted input/output, the length is
the number of characters.
If the file is connected for unformatted input/output, the length is
measured in processor-dependent units (bytes).
See the compiler User's Guide for a discussion of record length or
size.
If there is no connection or if the file is not connected for direct
access then the value is undefined.
.xt on
The
.kw RECL=
specifier is also allowed if the file is connected for sequential access.
.xt off
.note NEXTREC = nr
.id nr
is an integer variable or integer array element that is
assigned the value
.id n+1,
where
.id n
is the record number of the last record read or written on the
file connected for direct access.
If the file is connected but no records have been read or written
then the value is 1.
If the file is not connected for direct access or if the position of
the file can not be determined because of an input/output error then
.id nr
becomes undefined.

If there is no connection, or if the file is not connected for
formatted input/output,
.id blnk
becomes undefined.

.note
The
.kw IOSTAT=
specifier variable is always defined with the most
recent error status.
If an error occurs during execution of the
.kw INQUIRE
statement then the error status is defined with a positive integer;
otherwise the status is that of the most recent input/output statement
which referenced that file.
.note
The specifier always becomes defined unless an error condition occurs.
.note
This specifier becomes defined with a value only if the file name
specified in the
.kw FILE=
specifier is an acceptable file name and the named file exists.
Also, no error condition can occur during the execution of the
.kw INQUIRE
statement.
.note
This specifier becomes defined with a value if and only if
.id od

Also, no error condition can occur during the execution of the

This specifier
.us may
become defined with a value only if
.id od

However, there may be other conditions under which this specifier
does not become defined with a value.
In other words, (5) is a necessary, but not sufficient condition.
For example,

is undefined if the file is not connected for formatted input/output.
