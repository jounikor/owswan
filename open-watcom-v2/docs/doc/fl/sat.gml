is an executable statement other than an

statement.

The
.kw AT END
control statement is an extension of the
.kw END=
option of the
.kw READ
statement for sequential files.
It allows a statement or a block of code following the
.kw READ
statement to be executed when an end-of-file condition is
encountered during the read.
The
.kw AT END
statement or block is by-passed if no end-of-file occurs.
It is not valid to use this control statement with direct-access or
internal files.
It is not valid to use this statement when
.kw END=
is also specified in the
.kw READ
statement.
The
.kw AT END
statement or block must immediately follow the
.kw READ
statement to which it applies.
