&product is an implementation of the American National Standard
programming language FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-1978, commonly referred to as
FORTRAN 77.
The language level supported by &product compilers includes the full
language definition as well as significant extensions to the language.
&product compilers are based upon some well known FORTRAN language
compilers, namely the University of Waterloo's WATFOR and WATFIV-S
compilers (implementations for the International Business Machines 370
series) and the WATFOR-11 compiler (an implementation for the Digital
Equipment PDP11).
.np
This manual describes the language level supported by &product
including extensions to the standard language.
Shaded areas in the book denote a &product language extension.
Occasionally, where an entire section or chapter deals with a language
extension, the text may not be shaded.
Users should note that extensions which are supported by this compiler
may not be supported by other compilers.
We leave the choice to use a particular extension to the discretion of
the programmer.
.np
An accompanying manual, the User's Guide, contains system specific
topics such as how to run the software on your system, file system
support, compiler options, etc.
