.np
The options specified in environment variables are processed before
options specified on the command line.
The above examples define the default options to be "d1" (include line
number debugging information in the object file), and "ot" (favour
time optimizations over size optimizations).
.if '&target' ne 'QNX' .do begin
.np
.ix 'environment string' '= substitute'
.ix 'environment string' '#'
Whenever you wish to specify an option that requires the use of an
"=" character, you can use the "#" character in its place.
This is required by the syntax of the "&setcmdup" command.
.do end
.np
Once a particular environment variable has been defined, those options
listed become the default each time the associated compiler is used.
The compiler command line can be used to override any options
specified in the environment string.
.*
.if '&target' ne 'QNX' .do begin
.np
These environment variables are not examined by the &wclname utilities.
Since the &wclname utilities pass the relevant options found in their
associated environment variables to the compiler command line, their
environment variable options take precedence over the options
specified in the environment variables associated with the compilers.
.do end

The following are some examples of using &product to compile &lang
source programs.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. report &sw.d1 &sw.s
.exam end
.pc
The compiler processes
.fi report.c(pp)
producing an object file which contains source line number
information.
Stack overflow checking is omitted from the object code.
.ix 'memory model'
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. &sw.mm &sw.fpc calc
.exam end
.pc
The compiler compiles
.fi calc.c(pp)
for the Intel "medium" memory model and generates calls to
floating-point library emulation routines for all floating-point
operations.
Memory models are described in the
chapter entitled :HDREF refid='mdl86'..
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. kwikdraw &sw.2 &sw.fpi87 &sw.oaxt
.exam end
.pc
The compiler processes
.fi kwikdraw.c(pp)
producing 16-bit object code for an Intel 286 system equipped with an
Intel 287 numeric data processor (or any upward compatible 386/387,
486DX, or Pentium system).
While the choice of these options narrows the number of microcomputer
systems where this code will execute, the resulting code will be
highly optimized for this type of system.
.ix 'memory model'
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. &sw.mf &sw.3s calc
.exam end
.pc
The compiler compiles
.fi calc.c(pp)
for the Intel 32-bit "flat" memory model.
The compiler will generate 386 instructions based on 386 instruction
timings using the stack-based argument passing convention.
The resulting code will be optimized for Intel 386 systems.
Memory models are described in the
chapter entitled :HDREF refid='mdl386'..
Argument passing conventions are described in the
chapter entitled :HDREF refid='cal386'..
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. kwikdraw &sw.4r &sw.fpi87 &sw.oaimxt
.exam end
.pc
The compiler processes
.fi kwikdraw.c(pp)
producing 32-bit object code for an Intel 386-compatible system
equipped with a 387 numeric data processor.
The compiler will generate 386 instructions based on 486 instruction
timings using the register-based argument passing convention.
The resulting code will be highly optimized for Intel 486 systems.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. ..&pc.source&pc.modabs &sw.d2
.exam end
.pc
The compiler processes
.fi ~..&pc.source&pc.modabs.c(pp)
(a file in a directory which is adjacent to the current one).
The object file is placed in the current directory.
Included with the object code and data is information on local
symbols and data types.
The code generated is straight-forward, unoptimized code which can
be readily debugged with the &dbgname..
.exam begin 2
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
&prompt.&setcmd &setdelim.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF.=&sw.i=&pc.includes &sw.mc&setdelim.

.do end
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. &pc.cprogs&pc.grep.tst &sw.fi=iomods.c
.exam end
.pc
The compiler processes the program contained in the file
.fi &pc.cprogs&pc.grep.tst.
The file
.fi iomods.c
is included as if it formed part of the source input stream.
The include search path and memory model options are defaults each
time the compiler is invoked.
The memory model option could be overridden on the command line.
After looking for an "include" file in the current directory, the
compiler will search each directory listed in the "i" path.
See the section entitled :HDREF refid='wccinc'. for more information.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. grep &sw.fo=..&pc.obj&pc.
.exam end
.pc
The compiler processes the program contained in the file
.fi grep.c(pp)
which is located in the current directory.
The object file is placed in the directory
.fi ~..&pc.obj
under the name
.fi grep&obj..
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. &sw.dDBG=1 grep &sw.fo=..&pc.obj&pc..dbo
.exam end
.pc
The compiler processes the program contained in the file
.fi grep.c(pp)
which is located in the current directory.
The macro "DBG" is defined so that conditional debugging statements
that have been placed in the source are compiled.
The object file is placed in the directory
.fi ~..&pc.obj
and its filename extension will be ".dbo" (instead of "&obj").
Selection of a different filename extension permits easy
identification of object files that have been compiled with debugging
statements.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. &sw.g=GKS &sw.s &pc.gks&pc.gopks
.exam end
.pc
The compiler generates code for
.fi gopks.c(pp)
and places it into the "GKS" group.
If the "g" option had not been specified, the code would not have
been placed in any group.
Assume that this file contains the definition of the routine
.id gopengks
as follows:
.millust begin
void far gopengks( int workstation, long int h )
{
    .
    .
    .
}
.millust end
.pc
For a small code model, the routine
.id gopengks
must be defined in this file as
.kwm far
since it is placed in another group.
The "s" option is also specified to prevent a run-time call to the
stack overflow check routine which will be placed in a different
code segment at link time.
The
.id gopengks
routine must be prototyped by C routines in other groups as
.millust begin
void far gopengks( int workstation, long int h );
.millust end
.pc
since it will appear in a different code segment.

.section *refid=wccdiag Compiler Diagnostics
.*
.np
.ix 'diagnostics' '&product'
.ix 'error file' '&err'
If the compiler prints diagnostic messages to the screen, it will also
place a copy of these messages in a file in your current directory.
The file will have the same file name as the source file and an
extension of "&err".
The compiler issues two types of diagnostic messages, namely
warnings or errors.
A warning message does not prevent the production of an object
file.
However, error messages indicate that a problem is severe enough
that it must be corrected before the compiler will produce an
object file.
The error file is a handy reference when you wish to correct the
errors in the source file.
.np
Just to illustrate the diagnostic features of &product, we will modify
the "hello" program in such a way as to introduce some errors.
.exam begin
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
  {
     int x;
     printf( "Hello world\n" );
     return( y );
  }
.exam end
.np
The equivalent C++ program follows:
.exam begin
#include <iostream.h>
#include <iomanip.h>

int main()
{
    int x;
    cout << "Hello world" << endl;
    return( y );
}
.exam end
.np
In this example, we have added the lines:
.millust begin
int x;
.millust end
.pc
and
.millust begin
return( y );
.millust end
.pc
and changed the keyword
.kwm void
to
.kwm int
.period
.np
We compile the program with the "warning" option.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. hello &sw.w3
.exam end
.np
For the C program, the following output appears on the screen.
.code begin
hello.c(7): Error! E1011: Symbol 'y' has not been declared
hello.c(5): Warning! W202: Symbol 'x' has been defined, but not
                           referenced
hello.c: 8 lines, included 174, 1 warnings, 1 errors

.code end
.np
.ix 'diagnostics' 'error'
.ix 'diagnostics' 'warning'
Here we see an example of both types of messages.
An error and a warning message have been issued.
As indicated by the error message, we require a declarative
statement for the identifier
.id y
.period
The warning message indicates that, while it is not a violation of
the rules of &lang. to define a variable without ever using it, we
probably did not intend to do so.
Upon examining the program, we find that:
.autopoint
.point
the variable
.id x
should have been assigned a value, and
.point
the variable
.id y
has probably been incorrectly typed and should have been entered as
.id x
.period

.np
.ix 'include' 'directive'
.ix 'include' 'header file'
.ix 'include' 'source file'
.ix 'header file' 'including'
.ix 'source file' 'including'
.ix '#include'
When using the
.id #include
preprocessor directive, a header is identified by a sequence of
characters placed between the "<" and ">" delimiters (e.g., <file>)
and a source file is identified by a sequence of characters enclosed
by quotation marks (e.g., "file").
&product makes a distinction between the use of "<>" or quotation
marks to surround the name of the file to be included.
The search techniques for header files and source files are slightly
different.
Consider the following example.
.exam begin 2
#include <stdio.h>  /* a system header file */
#include "stdio.h"  /* your own header or source file */
.exam end
.pc
You should use "<" and ">" when referring to standard or system header
files and quotation marks when referring to your own header and source
files.
.np
The character sequence placed between the delimiters in an
.id #include
directive represents the name of the file to be included.
The file name may include &drive, path, and extension.
.np
It is not necessary to include the &drive and path specifiers in the
file specification when the file resides on a different &drive or in a
different directory.
&product provides a mechanism for looking up include files which may
be located in various directories and disks of the computer system.
&product searches directories for header and source files in the
following order (the search stops once the file has been located):
.ix 'include file' 'searching'
.ix 'header file' 'searching'
.ix 'source file' 'searching'
.autonote
.note
If the file specification enclosed in quotation marks ("file-spec") or
angle brackets (<file-spec>) contains the complete &drive and path
specification, that file is included (provided it exists).
No other searching is performed.
The &drive need not be specified in which case the current &drive is
assumed.
.note
.ix 'options' 'xx'
Next, if the "xx" option was not specified and the file specification is
enclosed in quotation marks then the current directory is searched.
.note
Next, if the file specification is enclosed in quotation marks, the
directory of the file containing the
.id #include
directive is searched.
.note
Next, if the "xx" option was not specified and the current file is also an
.id #include
file then the directory of the parent file is searched next.
This search continues recursively through all the nested
.id #include
files until the original source file's directory is searched.
.note
.ix 'options' 'i'
Next, if the file specification enclosed in quotation marks
("file-spec") or in angle brackets (<file-spec>), each directory
listed in the "i" path is searched (in the order that they were
specified).
.note
.ix 'options' 'bt'
.ix 'options' 'x'
Next, if the "x" option was not specified, each directory listed in the
.ev <os>_INCLUDE
environment variable is searched (in the order that they were
specified).
The environment variable name is constructed from the current build
target name.
The default build targets are:
.begpoint
.point DOS
when the host operating system is DOS,
.point OS2
when the host operating system is OS/2,
.point NT
when the host operating system is Windows NT/95,
.point QNX
when the host operating system is QNX, or
.point LINUX
when the host operating system is Linux.
.endpoint
.np
For example, the environment variable
.ev OS2_INCLUDE
will be searched if the build target is "OS2".
The build target would be OS/2 if:
.autopoint
.point
the host operating system is OS/2 and the "bt" option was not
specified, or
.point
the "bt=OS2" option was explicitly specified.
.endpoint
.note
Next, if the "x" option was not specified, each directory listed in the
.ev &incvarup
environment variable is searched (in the order that they were
specified).
.note
.ix '&hdrdirup directory'
Finally, if the "xx" option was not specified and the file specification
is enclosed in quotation marks then an adjacent "H" directory (i.e.,
.fi ~..&pc.h
.ct ) is searched if it exists.
.endnote
.np
In the above example,
.id <stdio.h>
and
.id "stdio.h"
could refer to two different files if there is a
.fi stdio.h
in the current directory and one in the &product include file
directory
.fi (&pathnamup&hdrdirup)
and the current directory is not listed in an "i" path or the
.ev &incvarup
environment variable.
.np
The compiler will search the directories listed in "i" paths (see
description of the "i" option) and the
.ev &incvarup
environment variable in a manner analogous to that which the operating
system shell will use when searching for programs by using the
.ev PATH
environment variable.
.np
The "&setcmdup" command is used to define an
.ev &incvarup
environment variable that contains a list of directories.
.ix '&setcmdup' '&incvarup environment variable'
A command of the form
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
.millust begin
&setcmd &incvarup=path&ps.path...
.millust end
.do end
.el .do begin
.millust begin
&setcmdup &incvarup=[d:]path;[d:]path...
.millust end
.do end
.pc
is issued before running &product the first time.
.if '&target' ne 'QNX' .do begin
The brackets indicate that the drive "d:" is optional and the ellipsis
indicates that any number of paths may be specified.
For Windows NT, use the "System" icon in the Control Panel to define
environment variables.

.ix '&setcmdup' '&incvarup environment variable'
In the above example, the "&setcmdup" command is used to define the
.ev &incvarup
environment variable.
It specifies that the
.fi &pathnam&hdrdir
directory
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
(of the current node)
.do end
.el .do begin
(of the "C" disk)
.do end
and the
.fi &pc.headers
directory
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
(a directory on node 1)
.do end
.el .do begin
(a directory of the "B" disk)
.do end
are to be searched.
.np
.ix 'options' 'i'
The &product "i" option defines a third place to search for
include files.
The advantage of the
.ev &incvarup
environment variable is that it need not be specified each time the
compiler is run.
.*
.section *refid=wccprep &product Preprocessor
.*
.np
.ix 'preprocessor'
The &product preprocessor forms an integral part of &product..
When any form of the "p" option is specified, only the preprocessor is
invoked.
No code is generated and no object file is produced.
The output of the preprocessor is written to the standard output file,
although it can also be redirected to a file using the "fo" option.
Suppose the following &lang. program is contained in the file
.fi msgid.c.
.keep 20
.exam begin
#define _IBMPC 0
#define _IBMPS2 1

#if _TARGET == _IBMPS2
char *SysId = { "IBM PS/2" };
#else
char *SysId = { "IBM PC" };
#endif

/* Return pointer to System Identification */

char *GetSysId()
  {
    return( SysId );
  }
.exam end
.pc
We can use the &product preprocessor to generate the &lang. code that
would actually be compiled by the compiler by issuing the following
command.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. msgid &sw.plc &sw.fo &sw.d_TARGET=_IBMPS2
.exam end
.pc
The file
.fi msgid&pxt
will be created and will contain the following &lang. code.
.millust begin
#line 1 "msgid.c"




char *SysId = { "IBM PS/2" };
#line 9 "msgid.c"

/* Return pointer to System Identification */

char *GetSysId()
  {
    return( SysId );
  }
.millust end
.pc
Note that the file
.fi msgid&pxt
can be used as input to the compiler.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. msgid&pxt
.exam end
.pc
Since
.id #line
directives are present in the file, the compiler can issue error
messages in terms of the original source file line numbers.

.section *refid=wccmacs &product Predefined Macros
.*
.np
In addition to the standard ISO-defined macros supported by the
&product compilers, several additional system-dependent macros are
also defined.
These are described in this section.
See the
.book &company C Language Reference
manual for a description of the standard macros.
.np
The &product compilers run on various host operating systems
including DOS, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95 and QNX.
Any of the supported host operating systems can be used to develop
applications for a number of target systems.
By default, the target operating system for the application is the
same as the host operating system unless some option or combination of
options is specified.
For example, DOS applications are built on DOS by default, OS/2
applications are built on OS/2 by default, and so on.
But the flexibility is there to build applications for other operating
systems/environments.
.np
The macros described below may be used to identify the target system
for which the application is being compiled.
(Note: In several places in the following text, a pair of underscore
characters appears as __ which resembles a single, elongated
underscore.)
.np
The &product compilers support both 16-bit and 32-bit application
development.
The following macros are defined for 16-bit and 32-bit target systems.

The
.kwm __X86__
identifies the target as an Intel environment.
.note
The
.kwm __I86__
.ct ,
.kwm M_I86

.note
The
.kwm __386__
.ct ,
.kwm M_I386
and
.kwm _M_I386
macros identify the target as a 32-bit Intel environment.
.note
The
.kwm _M_IX86
macro is identically equal to 100 times the architecture compiler
option value (&sw.0, &sw.1, &sw.2, &sw.3, &sw.4, &sw.5, etc.).
If "&sw.5" (Pentium instruction timings) was specified as a compiler
option, then the value of
.kwm _M_IX86
would be 500.

.section *refid=wccext &product Extended Keywords
.*
.np
&product supports the use of some special keywords to describe system
dependent attributes of functions and other object names.
These attributes are inspired by the Intel processor architecture and
the plethora of function calling conventions in use by compilers for
this architecture.
In keeping with the ISO C and C++ language standards, &product
uses the double underscore (i.e., "__") or single underscore followed
by uppercase letter (e.g., "_S") prefix with these keywords.
To support compatibility with other C/C++ compilers, alternate forms
of these keywords are also supported through predefined macros.

In the OS/2 operating system (version 2.0 or higher), the first 512
megabytes of the 4 gigabyte segment referenced by the DS register is
divided into 8192 areas of 64K bytes each.

the compiler to convert any 32-bit pointer arguments to far16
pointers, and any
.kw int
arguments from 32 bits to 16 bits.
(In the 16-bit environment, an object of type
.kw int

.np
.ix 'based pointers'
Near pointers are generally the most efficient type of pointer because
they are small, and the compiler can assume knowledge about what
segment of the computer's memory the pointer (offset) refers to.
Far pointers are the most flexible because they allow the programmer
to access any part of the computer's memory, without limitation to a
particular segment.
However, far pointers are bigger and slower because of the additional
flexibility.
.np
Based pointers are a compromise between the efficiency of near
pointers and the flexibility of far pointers.
With based pointers, the programmer takes responsibility to tell the
compiler which segment a near pointer (offset) belongs to, but may
still access segments of the computer's memory outside of the normal
data segment (DGROUP).
The result is a pointer type which is as small as and almost as
efficient as a near pointer, but with most of the flexibility of a far
pointer.
.np
An object declared as a based pointer falls into one of the following
categories:
.begbull $compact
.* .bull
.* the based pointer is in the same segment as another named object,
.bull
the based pointer is in the segment described by another object,
.bull
the based pointer, used as a pointer to another object of the same
type (as in a linked list), refers to the same segment,
.bull
the based pointer is an offset to no particular segment, and must be
combined explicitly with a segment value to produce a valid pointer.
.endbull
.np
To support based pointers, the following keywords are provided:
.ix '__based'
.ix '__segment'
.ix '__segname'
.ix '__self'
.millust begin
__based
__segment
__segname

.ix 'based pointers' 'segment constant'
A segment constant based pointer or object has its segment value based
on a specific, named segment.
A segment constant based object is specified as:
.illust begin

.illust end
.pc
and a segment constant based pointer is specified as:
.illust begin
[type] __based( __segname( "segment" ) ) *object-name;
.illust end
.pc
where
.id segment
is the name of the segment in which the pointer or object is based.
As shown above, the segment name is always specified as a string.
There are four special segment names recognized by the compiler:
.millust begin
"_CODE"
"_CONST"
"_DATA"
"_STACK"
.millust end
.pc
The
.mono "_CODE"
segment is the default code segment.
The
.mono "_CONST"
segment is the segment containing constant values.
The
.mono "_DATA"
segment is the default data segment.
The
.mono "_STACK"
segment is the segment containing the stack.
If the segment name is not one of the recognized names, then a
segment will be created with that name.
If a segment constant based object is being defined, then it will be
placed in the named segment.
If a segment constant based pointer is being defined, then it can
point at objects in the named segment.
.np
The following examples illustrate segment constant based pointers and
objects.
.exam begin

.id ival
is an object that resides in the default code segment.
.id iptr
is an object that resides in the data segment (the usual place for
data objects), but points at an integer which resides in the default
code segment.
.id iptr
is suitable for pointing at
.id ival
.period
.exam begin
char __based( __segname( "GOODTHINGS" ) ) thing;

.id cptr
.period
The object
.id seg
might be assigned values such as the following:
.begbull $compact

.section Void Based Pointers

.np
.ix 'based pointers' 'void'
A void based pointer must be explicitly combined with a segment value
to produce a reference to a memory location.
A void based pointer does not infer its segment value from another
object.
.ix 'operator' ':>'
.ix 'base operator'
The
.mono :>
(base) operator is used to combine a segment value and a void based
pointer.
.np
For example, on a personal computer running DOS with a color monitor,
the screen memory begins at segment 0xB800, offset 0.
In a video text mode, to examine the first character currently
displayed on the screen, the following code could be used:
.exam begin
extern void main()
{
    __segment             screen;
    char __based( void ) *scrptr;

    screen = 0xB800;
    scrptr = 0;
    printf( "Top left character is '%c'.\n",
            *(screen:>scrptr) );
}
.exam end
.np
The general form of the
.mono :>
operator is:
.illust begin
segment :> offset
.illust end
.pc
where
.id segment
is an expression of type
.kwm __segment
.ct , and
.id offset
is an expression of type
.id __based( void ) *
.period

.section Self Based Pointers
.*
.np
.ix 'based pointers' 'self'
A self based pointer infers its segment value from itself.
It is particularly useful for structures such as linked lists, where
all of the list elements are in the same segment.
A self based pointer pointing to one element may be used to access the
next element, and the compiler will use the same segment as the
original pointer.
.np
The following example illustrates a function which will print the
values stored in the last two members of a linked list:
.exam begin
struct a {
    struct a __based( __self ) *next;
    int                         number;
};

.exam break
extern void PrintLastTwo( struct a far *list )
{
  __segment                seg;
  struct a __based( seg ) *aptr;

  seg  = FP_SEG( list );
  aptr = FP_OFF( list );
  for( ; aptr != _NULLOFF; aptr = aptr->next ) {
    if( aptr->next == _NULLOFF ) {
      printf( "Last item is %d\n",
              aptr->number );
    } else if( aptr->next->next == _NULLOFF ) {
      printf( "Second last item is %d\n",
              aptr->number );
    }
  }
}
.exam end
.np
The argument to the function
.id PrintLastTwo
is a far pointer, pointing to a linked list structure anywhere in
memory.
It is assumed that all members of a particular linked list of this
type reside in the same segment of the computer's memory.
(Another instance of the linked list might reside entirely in a
different segment.)
The object
.id seg
is given the segment portion of the far pointer.
The object
.id aptr
is given the offset portion, and is described as being based in the
segment stored in
.id seg
.period
.np
The expression
.id aptr->next
refers to the
.id next
member of the structure stored in memory at the offset stored in
.id aptr
and
the segment implied by
.id aptr
.ct , which is the value stored in
.id seg
.period
So far, the behavior is no different than if
.id next
had been declared as,
.millust begin
struct a *next;
.millust end
.np
The expression
.id aptr->next->next
illustrates the difference of using a self based pointer.
The first part of the expression (
.ct .id aptr->next
.ct ) occurs as described above.
However, using the result to point to the next member occurs by using
the offset value found in the
.id next
member and combining it with the segment value of the
.ul pointer used to get to that member,
which is still the segment implied by
.id aptr
.ct , which is the value stored in
.id seg
.period
If
.id next
had not been declared using
.id __based( __self )
.ct , then the second pointing operation would refer to the offset value
found in the
.id next
member, but with the default data segment (DGROUP), which may or may
not be the same segment as stored in
.id seg
.period

.section *refid=wccdecl The __declspec Keyword
.*
.np
.ix 'keywords' '__declspec'
&product supports the
.kwm __declspec
keyword for compatibility with Microsoft C++.
The
.kwm __declspec
keyword is used to modify storage-class attributes of functions and/or
data.
.begnote
.*
.note __declspec( thread )
.*
is used to define thread local storage (TLS).
TLS is the mechanism by which each thread in a multithreaded process
allocates storage for thread-specific data.
In standard multithreaded programs, data is shared among all threads
of a given process, whereas thread local storage is the mechanism for
allocating per-thread data.
.exam begin
__declspec(thread) static int tls_data = 0;
.exam end
.np
The following rules apply to the use of the
.kwm thread
attribute.
.begbull
.bull
The
.kwm thread
attribute can be used with data and objects only.
.bull
You can specify the
.kwm thread
attribute only on data items with static storage duration.
This includes global data objects (both
.kwm static
and
.kwm extern
.ct ), local static objects, and static data members of classes.
Automatic data objects cannot be declared with the
.kwm thread
attribute.
The following example illustrates this error:
.exam begin
#define TLS __declspec( thread )
void func1()
{
    TLS int tls_data;           // Wrong!
}

int func2( TLS int tls_data )   // Wrong!
{
    return tls_data;
}
.exam end
.bull
The
.kwm thread
attribute must be used for both the declaration and the definition of
a thread local object, whether the declaration and definition occur in
the same file or separate files.
The following example illustrates this error:
.exam begin
#define TLS __declspec( thread )
extern int tls_data;    // This generates an error, because the
TLS    int tls_data;    // declaration and the definition differ.
.exam end
.bull
Classes cannot use the
.kwm thread
attribute.
However, you can instantiate class objects with the
.kwm thread
attribute, as long as the objects do not need to be constructed or
destructed.
For example, the following code generates an error:
.exam begin
#define TLS __declspec( thread )
TLS class A     // Wrong! Classes are not objects
{
    // Code
};
A AObject;
.exam end
.np
Because the declaration of objects that use the
.kwm thread
attribute is permitted, these two examples are semantically
equivalent:
.exam begin
#define TLS __declspec( thread )
TLS class B
{
    // Code
} BObject;      // Okay! BObject declared thread local.

class C
{
    // Code
};
TLS C CObject;  // Okay! CObject declared thread local.
.exam end
.bull
Standard C permits initialization of an object or variable with an
expression involving a reference to itself, but only for objects of
non-static extent.
Although C++ normally permits such dynamic initialization of an object
with an expression involving a reference to itself, this type of
initialization is not permitted with thread local objects.
.exam begin
#define TLS  __declspec( thread )
TLS int tls_i = tls_i;            // C and C++ error
int j = j;                        // Okay in C++; C error
TLS int tls_k = sizeof( tls_k );  // Okay in C and C++
.exam end
.np
Note that a
.kwm sizeof
expression that includes the object being initialized does not
constitute a reference to itself and is allowed in C and C++.
