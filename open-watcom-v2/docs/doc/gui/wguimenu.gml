.ix 'Menu Editor'
Windows applications typically contain menus that enable users to
initiate actions. When users see familiar menus in the menu bar, such
as the File or Edit menu, they may feel less intimidated by a new
application and be more apt to explore its capabilities.
.np
In an application you can have three types of menu items:
.begbull $compact
.bull
Standard
.bull
Popup
.bull
Separator
.endbull
.np
A standard menu item performs a function when selected. A popup menu
item is a menu item with a sub-menu. Selecting a popup menu reveals
another menu list, rather than performing a function. A separator is a
horizontal line that separates groups of menu items within a popup
menu. A resource file can have multiple menus.
.np
The &company Menu Editor enables you to create new menus and edit
existing menus found in resource files.
A resource file may contain multiple menus.
.np
With the Menu Editor you can create all of the menus needed for
your application visually, without having to create a resource
script or use a resource compiler.

The Menu Editor may be invoked in one of two ways. The first
involves first starting the Resource Editor then starting the Menu
Editor. The second way the editor may be started is from the &company IDE.
.np
To start the Menu Editor from the Resource Editor,
you must first open the Resource Editor. How
you proceed depends on whether you are opening a new (empty) menu
table or an existing menu table.

message box prompts you to save before exiting. Choose Yes to save the
changes and exit the Menu Editor, No to exit the Menu Editor without
saving the changes, or Cancel to return to the Menu Editor.
.np
When you exit the Menu Editor, the application remembers the directory
in which you last opened or saved a menu (not the resource file). The next
time you open a menu, the last directory accessed appears in the File
Selection dialog so you do not have to reenter its path. This feature
makes the Menu Editor more convenient and efficient to use.

.section Menu Editor: Resource Name Field
.*
.np
.ix 'Resource Name field'
.ix 'Menu Editor' 'Resource Name field'
The Resource Name field in the &company Menu Editor window contains the
name of the menu currently being edited. A resource file can contain more
than one menu, so it is important that the resource names for the menu
resources be unique. The Resource Name field is not case sensitive and
can hold up to 255 characters. You can enter a textual name, a number
or a symbol in this field.
.np
When you create a new menu, the Resource Editor assigns the default
name MENU_# to it. You can rename the menu using the Rename item in
the Resource menu.
.*
.section Menu Editor: The Preview Window
.*
.np
.ix 'Menu Editor' 'Preview Window'
.ix 'Preview Window' 'in Menu Editor'
The Preview window appears on the Menu Editor window above the menu
item list. This window allows you to see how the menu you are creating
will look in the application. The popup menu items in the preview
window are functional so you can test your menu as you create it.
:CMT. .figure *depth='1.24' *scale=200 *file='mnu3' The preview window allows you to see how the menu will look and work in the application.
.figure *depth='0.71' *scale=81 *file='mnu5' The preview window allows you to see how the menu will look and work in the application.
.np
You can use the sample menu that appears in the preview window to test
the behaviour of your menu items. For example, by selecting top-level
menu items in the preview window you can check the positions and
breaks of your menu items and separators. The preview window allows
you to verify that your menus cascade properly and that other
attributes function properly, including inactive, grayed, and check
marked menu items.
.*
.section Menu Editor: Attributes Area
.*
.np
.ix 'Attributes area'
.ix 'Menu Editor' 'attributes area'
The attributes area provides information about the currently selected
menu item. You can edit menu items using only the fields in this area.
.np
The attributes area displays menu item details in five sections.
Following is an explanation of each section.
.begpoint
.point Item Text
The Item Text field contains the name of the menu item. Whatever
appears in this field will appear in the menu.
.np
An ampersand (&) in front of a letter in this field tells the editor
to underscore that letter in the menu. This automatically creates a
hot key for that menu item. When using the menu, pressing ALT plus the
underscored letter activates that menu item.
.np
To specify a tab character, enter \t in this field. All text after \t
in the Item Text field will be right justified in the menu.
.point Item ID
The Item ID is the unique numeric identifier for the menu item. In the
source code, you match the identifier to the function the menu item is
to perform. The Item ID applies only to normal menu items. Popups and
separators do not perform functions, so do not need an identifier.
.np
You can enter any number in the range 0 to 65535 in the Item ID field.
Hexadecimal values can be entered by prefixing them with 0x. Octal
values can be entered by prefixing them with zero.
.np
The two Item ID fields contain:
.begbull $compact
.bull
the numeric identifier of the selected menu item
.bull
the symbol information for the selected menu item.
.endbull
.begnote
.note Note:
Both Menu Item fields currently contain the same numerical information
because the Menu Editor does not yet support symbols.
.endnote
.point Item Type
The Item Type section of the window indicates whether the selected
menu item is a popup, normal, or separator menu item. Following is a
description of each menu item type.
.begpoint
.point Popup
A popup menu is a menu item that has a sub-menu. When you select a
popup menu, another menu appears.
.point Normal
A normal menu item is an item that performs a function when selected.
.point Separator
A separator menu item is a horizontal line that separates menu items
to logically group menu items with similar functions. When a separator
is selected from the menu item list, the Item Text and Item ID fields
are always empty because they do not apply to separators.
.endpoint
.point Attributes
The options in the Attributes section allow you to specify how the
selected menu item will appear in the menu. Use the check boxes to
select the desired menu item characteristic. Following is a
description of each option.
.begpoint
.point Checked
When the Checked option is selected, the menu item appears in the menu
with a check mark beside it. This is a graphic only and does not
affect the functionality of the menu item.
.begnote
.note Note:
Top level menu items cannot be checked.
.endnote
.point Grayed
When the Grayed option is selected, the menu item text appears in gray
instead of black. This option also makes the menu item inactive.
.point Inactive
When the Inactive option is selected, the menu item appears unchanged
in the menu. However, this option prevents the menu item from being
selected.
.endpoint
.point Break Styles
The options in the Break Styles section control the positioning of the
menu items. The break styles you choose affects the selected menu item
and all menu items that follow that item. Following is a description
of the available options.
.begpoint
.point Help
The Help break option positions the selected menu to the far right of
the menu bar. This option is available only for top-level menus.
.point Menu
For top-level menu items, the Menu break option begins a new line in
the menu bar, positioning the selected menu item on the far left. In a
popup menu, this break option creates a new column, positioning the
selected menu item at the beginning of the new column.
.begnote
.note Note
The Menu option overrides the Menu Bar option.
.endnote
.point Menu Bar
For top-level menu items, the Menu Bar break option performs the same
function as the Menu break option. In a popup menu, the Menu Bar break
option creates a new column, beginning with the selected menu item and
places a vertical line between the columns.
.endpoint

.section Menu Editor: Menu Item List
.*
.np
.ix 'Menu Item List'
The menu item list displays the menu items in the current menu. Use
this list to view the attributes of the menu items listed. Select a
menu item from the table by clicking on it. Details of the selected
menu item appear in the attributes area of the window.
.*
.section Menu Editor: Action Buttons
.*
.np
.ix 'Action Buttons'
.ix 'Menu Editor' 'Action Buttons'
The action buttons control how the information in the attributes area
is handled by the editor. The Insert button will use the contents of
the attributes area to create a new entry in the menu. The Change
button will use the contents of the attributes area to modify the
current entry in the menu. The << (shift left) button will cause the
current menu item to become a subitem of its parent. This button is
enabled only when the current item is the last item in its parent
menu. The current item will visually appear to shift left. The >>
(shift right) button will cause the current menu item to become the
last subitem of the popup menu preceding it. This button is enabled
only when the item preceding the current item is a popup menu. The
current item will visually appear to shift right. The Reset button
will discard the contents of the attributes area and reset them to
those of the current entry in the menu. The Insert button is the
default button when the ENTER key is pressed and no other button has
the focus.
