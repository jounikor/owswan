.chap Profile Analysis Tools
.*
.np
This section describes how to use the profile analysis tools to enhance the
performance of your program. There are two profile analysis tools:
.begbull
.bull
The &smpname (the sampler)
.bull
The &prfname (the profiler)
.endbull
.np
You must use both of these tools to discover where your code is spending
time as it executes.
.np
First, you must run the
.us Sampler
.period
The sampler starts your application and, at a predetermined interval,
records the location where your program is executing.
This information is saved in a "sample file".
It is a statistical sampling of your program's execution.
It is not exact information, but it is accurate enough to be a very
useful tool to enhance your program's performance.
.refalso smprun
.np
Second, you run the
.us Profiler
.period
It reads the sample file and displays the sample information
graphically. You can use the profiler to examine the sample data
and narrow in on the places where your program spends large
amounts of time.
.refalso prfrun
.np
Once you have discovered heavily executed portions of your
program, you might want to rewrite then using a faster algorithm
or fine tune your implementation of the current algorithms.
.begnote
.note Note
You must compile and link the program with debugging information.
Use at least the
.us; d1
option when compiling and the
.us; debug all
option when linking.

.code begin
C>&smpcmd

Usage: wsample [options] program [program arguments]
Options:
    /b=<size> specify the buffer size for samples (default: 63)
    /f=<file> specify the output filename for the sample file
    /r=<rate> specify the sampling rate

    <size>    is a number in the range 1 to 63 (default: 63 kb)
    <rate>    is a number (range 27 to 1000) specifying the approximate
              time interval (in milliseconds) between samples
              (default: 55)

   '#' may be used instead of '=' in options (e.g., /b#10)

.code end
.*
.section *refid=smpopt Sampler Command Line Options
.*
.np
Command line options allow you
to control how much the program's execution will be affected by the
presence of the sampler.  System specific options are described in
detail in subsequent sections. The options that apply to all versions
of the sampler are:
.begnote
.ix 'sampler options' 'r'
.note /r=<sample_rate>
Specifies the approximate time between execution samples (in
milliseconds). The sampler will set up the system so that the program
will be interrupted in intervals of the number of milliseconds
specified on the command line. A smaller number will result in a more
accurate sample file. A larger number result in a less accurate
sample. If your program runs for a very short time, you should use the
smallest interval possible. The default value is system dependent and
it will be displayed if you enter "&smpcmdup" with no arguments. The
following example will sample the program's execution 200 times per
second.
.exam begin
C>&smpcmd /r=5 program
.exam end
.pc
.ix 'sampler options' 'b'
.note /b=<buffer_size>
Specifies the size of the sampler's internal buffer (in kilobytes).
The execution of the program will produce many samples which must be
recorded in the sample file.
The sampler stores the samples in an internal buffer until the buffer
is filled and must be written to the disk.
You may reduce the buffer size if you want to leave more memory for
your application program.
You should not make the buffer size so small that the sampler would
have to write samples to disk more than once a second.
The default size for the sample buffer is 63K.
In the following example, a buffer size of 10K will be used:
.exam begin
C>&smpcmd /b=10 program
.exam end
.pc
.ix 'sampler options' 'f'
.note /f=<fname>
Specify the name of the sample file.
Samples will be written to the specified file.
By default, a file with the same name as the executable and an
extension of &smpextup. is created.
.endnote
.*
.section *refid=smpos Sampler Operating System Considerations
.*
.np
There is a different version of the sampler to match each operating

.ix 'Virtual DOS Machine'
.ix 'real DOS'
.ix 'timer interrupt'
The sampler for an operating system such as DOS will not operate
correctly in an environment that is not strictly DOS such as
a Windows or OS/2 DOS box.
The sampler obtains its information about what was executing when a
timer interrupt occurs from the stack.
Unlike "real" DOS, the segment/offset on the stack in a protected-mode
environment supporting Virtual DOS Machines does not correspond to the
program that was executing at the time of the timer interrupt.
As a result, you must run the sampler in the real operating system
environment for which it was designed.
The same is true for Windows applications in a Win-OS/2 session.

.us back-out
of any detail view.
The levels of detail available are:
.begnote
.note Sample
This is a sample file.  The profiler can show you information from
several sample files at once.
.note Image
A sample file may consist of several images.  These are your main
executable file and any Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or NetWare
Loadable Modules (NLM) that your application called while
executing.
.note Modules
An image may consist of several modules.  Each module is a
compilation unit.  It consists of all the source code generated by
one invocation of the compiler.
.note Files
A module may be made up of several files.  Your application may
contain code that is generated by included files.
.note Functions
A file may contain several functions.  These are all of the global
functions that are defined within that file.
.note Source Lines
A function is made up of one or more source lines.
.note Assembler instructions
Each source line generates zero or more lines of assembler instructions.
It is possible to get
clues about expensive operations from the number of samples found
at each instruction.  For example, the C statement "i = j + k * l"
will generate a multiply instruction.  If you inspected the
assembler instructions, you might find that the multiply instruction took
the majority of the time in question.
.endnote
The process of moving from higher levels to lower levels, say, from
"modules" to "functions", is called
.us zooming in.
Moving from lower levels to higher levels ("assembler instructions" to "source
lines") is called
.us backing out.
As you zoom into your program the size of the region will get smaller
but the amount of detail will increase.
Likewise, backing out will restore previous levels to the larger
regions and reduced detail.
You may zoom-in and back-out of detail views in order to explore
your applications execution characteristics.

After you have run the sampler, you are left with a sample file.
It contains a record of all locations where your program was
interrupted by the sampler.  A

The most important piece of data that the profiler provides is the
percentage of time that a region of code contributes to total
execution time.
At the highest level (images), these percentages reflect each image's
contribution to the total execution time.
As you successively zoom into modules and functions, you may
become interested in the relative percentages.
.np
The percentage of time that a region contributes to the total
program execution time of the
.us program
is called an
.us absolute
percentage.
The percentage of time that a piece of a region contributes to the total
execution time
.us of your current detail level
is called a
.us relative
percentage.
.np
As you zoom in to the source and assembly views, the absolute
percentages of execution time may get quite small.  The relative
percentages help you to get a feel for the proportion of time
involved within the detail view, but don't get fooled into
thinking that a routine contributes more than it actually does.
Your decisions about which code to optimize should always be
based on absolute percentages.

.section *refid=prfuse How to Use the Profiler Effectively
.*
.np
The fundamental principle behind the profiler is:
.bd devote your
.bd attention to the heavily executed regions of the program in order to
.bd extract the most performance out of a program.
This principle can be applied to the different levels of detail within
a program.
You should focus on the modules that contribute the most time
to the execution of a program.
Within a module, you should focus on the functions that
contribute the most time to the module's total execution time.
Regions of the program that exhibit heavy use during the execution of
a program will benefit most from improvement.
.np
A simple example will illustrate how this is accomplished.
Suppose we have a program that has three distinct regions.
.begpoint $break
.notehd1 Region
.notehd2 Percentage
.point 1
10%
.point 2
70%
.point 3
20%
.endpoint
.pc
The percentages represent the percentage of the total execution time
that the region contributed.
If the program took 100 seconds to execute, we could know that regions
1, 2, and 3 took 10, 70, and 20 seconds respectively.
Now suppose we could rewrite region 1 so that it was twice as fast.
What would be the impact on the total execution time of the program?
It is difficult to predict precisely but, as a rule of thumb,
we would expect that if we made region 1 twice as fast, it would only
take 5% of the original execution time as opposed to the original 10%
before optimization.
So, if the original program took 100 seconds to execute, we would
expect region 1's contribution of time to drop from 10 seconds to 5
seconds making the execution time of the new program now 95 seconds.
Notice that the region of code was twice as fast as before but the
total effect on the execution of the program was small.
The impact of rewriting the code was reduced because the region did
not contribute greatly to the execution time of the original program.
.np
To illustrate the point of using a profiler tool to increase
performance, let us now look at the effect on the program execution
speed if we were to recode region 2 so that it was twice as fast as
before.
Using the previous rule of thumb, we would expect region 2's
contribution to the original execution time to drop from 70% to 35%.
Now, if the original program took 100 seconds to execute, we would
have reduced the total execution time to 65 seconds by focusing on
region 2.
Comparing these results, we can see that the most benefit was derived
from doubling the speed of region 2 as opposed to doubling the speed
of region 1.
The change in region 2 reduced the execution time by 35% while the
change to region 1 reduced the execution time by 5% for roughly the
same amount of work.
The large amount of work involved in speeding up code means that the
most productive avenue is to focus on the heavily executed regions of
the program.

The profiler does not run under NetWare.  After you have run
the sampler under NetWare, you will have to run the profiler
under DOS, OS/2 or Windows.  By default, the sample file will be
created in the root directory of the file server. Log into
the file server from a workstation and specify the name of
the sample file on the server when you start the profiler.
All NLMs should be found automatically.  If they are not,
copy the sample file and all relevant NLMs to the current directory
on your workstation then try running the profiler again.
