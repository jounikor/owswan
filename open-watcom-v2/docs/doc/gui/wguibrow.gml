Imagine being assigned to a project with thousands of lines of C++
source code.
Learning the relationship between the objects of such an application
can be very difficult.
The &br was developed to solve this very problem &mdash. to help
developers better understand the source code they are working with.
Information such as the class inheritance hierarchy and the call tree
for an application can be studied while using the &br..
Once you have located a symbol, you can quickly view the source file
that contains its definition or list all the files that reference it.
Viewing these relationships helps you understand how the program works.
.np
This chapter describes the many tasks you can perform with the &br,
including creating and opening a Browser database file, configuring
the Browser session, and viewing the list of all symbols in your
program, the class inheritance hierarchy, and call structure.

.section Browser Files
.*
.np
.ix '&br' 'files'
.ix 'module file' 'in &br'
To browse your source code, you must first create a &br module
file for each source file that you wish to browse.
Currently, browsing is supported by the &watc compilers only
(&watf does not support browsing).
To create a &br module file, specify the "db" option when you
compile the source file.
If you are using the &wide, select
.us Emit Browser Information
from the
.us Debugging Switches
panel of the
.us Compiler Switches
dialog.
The &br module file will have the same name as the source file and
an extension of ".MBR".
.np
Once the &br module files have been created, these files are merged
and a &br database file is created.
This process eliminates redundant information such as duplicate
definitions that occur when a header file is included by many source
files.
Browser database files have the extension ".DBR".
.np
The &br allows you to configure your session and saves this
configuration to an options file.
Options files have the extension ".OBR".
The file name
.fi setup.obr
is the default name of the options file.
The default options file is automatically loaded by the Browser when
the Browser is started.

.np
.ix '&br' 'merger utility'
.ix 'merger' 'with &br'
A separate utility, called the merger, is used to create the database
file.
The name of the merger program is
.fi wbrg.exe.
.ix 'MBR files'
Its command line consists of the name of the database file and a list
of the module files (.MBR files) to be merged.
The name of the database file must be preceded by a
.mono database
command.
.ix 'DBR files'
The default extension given to the database file is ".DBR".
The list of module files must be preceded by a
.mono file
command.
The module file names must be separated by commas or enclosed by curly
braces and separated by spaces.
The list of module file names can contain wild cards.
The following are examples of valid merger commands.
In each case, the module files
.fi m1.mbr
and
.fi m2.mbr
will be processed and the database file
.fi db.dbr
will be created.
.millust begin
wbrg database db file m1, m2
wbrg database db file { m1 m2 }
wbrg file m1, m2 database db
wbrg file { m1 m2 } database db

.section *refid=brlist The List View
.*
.np
.ix '&br' 'browsing symbols'
.ix 'symbols' 'browsing'
Using the &br to view the symbols in your program is much faster than
searching through your source code for symbol information.
From the symbols list you can quickly access detailed information on a
symbol that tells you where the symbol is used and where it is
defined.
.np
To view a list of all symbols in the current Browser database file,
choose
.us List
from the
.us View
menu.
This displays a window which can list all symbols in your program.
The window has a vertical scroll bar that allows you to scroll through
the list of symbols in your program.
Since your program may contain a very large number of symbols, the
Browser does not load all the symbols in your program from the
database.
Instead, only the number of symbols that can be displayed in the
window are loaded.
As far as the Browser is concerned, this list is infinite.
For this reason, the scroll thumb on the vertical scroll bar is
positioned in the middle of the vertical scroll bar and cannot be
moved.
Click below the vertical scroll thumb to view the next page of symbols
and above the vertical scroll thumb to view the previous page of
symbols.
.figure *depth='2.66' *scale=51 *file='brow4' The List window displays all symbols in the current browser database file.
.np
Each symbol has a icon to its left.
A letter marking each icon indicates the symbol type in the source
code as follows:
.begpoint
.point F
Function
.point C
Class
.point T
Typedef
.point V
Variable
.point E
Enum
.endpoint
.np
There are several ways to display the detail view of symbols.
When you reveal the detail view, the file folder icon changes to an
open file folder.
To close the detail view dialog, click on the file folder.
This changes the icon back to a closed folder and closes the dialog.
To reveal the detail view of a symbol you can perform any of the
following actions:
.begbull
.bull
The file folder icons are hot spots that display the detail view of the
selected symbol.
To activate the hot spot, click once on the symbol name to select it
and press ENTER to reveal the detail view.
.bull
Click once on the file folder to reveal the detail view for that
symbol.

This allows you to see the relationships between base classes and
derived classes.
In the inheritance hierarchy, each node represents a class.
.figure *depth='2.66' *scale=51 *file='brow5' The Inheritance view displays the hierarchy of all C++ classes in your program (graph view shown).
.np
There are two different tree views you can choose from to display the
class hierarchy:
.begpoint $break
.point Graph view
The graph view displays each class in a box.
A box, or node, is connected to another node if one is a derived class
of the other.
The root node of the tree is the base class for all nodes in the tree.
The tree is initially fully expanded.
See the section entitled :HDREF refid='brtree'. for more information
on removing and expanding nodes from the tree.
.point Outline view
The outline view displays the same information as the graph view but
in a different way.
The outline view is initially fully collapsed.
That is, only the base classes are displayed.
In order to view the derived classes of a node, you must single click
on the node.
This expands the node, displaying all its immediate derived classes.

.section Setting Source Search Paths

.np
.ix 'path option'
.ix '&br' 'path option'
.ix 'source search path'
.ix 'search path'
You can specify a command line option to the &br that allows you to
specify alternate source file search paths.
This option is useful when a database file is created on a system
different from the one that is used to browse the application source
code.
The syntax of the command line option is:
.millust begin
path path_spec1;path_spec2;...
.millust end
.np
Since the database files record explicit paths to source files, it is
likely that the path will no longer be valid once the software is
moved to another system.
.np
.ix 'path search'
When the &br cannot locate the specified file using its explicit path,
it will search the paths listed in the path option.
