.ix 'Resource Editor'
The &company Resource Editor is a full-featured editor that enables
you to easily create and edit resources and the files that contain
them. A file containing one or more resources will generally be
referred to as a resource file. A resource file may be an executable
(.EXE), resource file (.RES), dynamic link library (.DLL), bitmap file
(.BMP), cursor file (.CUR), or icon file (.ICO). The editor also
supports a variety of resource scripts. They include dialog (.DLG),
accelerator (.ACC), menu (.MNU), and string (.STR) scripts. This
support is accomplished by maintaining a synchronized resource file
(.RES) in the same directory as the resource script.

Opening a resource file reveals a Resource window in the Resource
Editor window. This window is a visual representation of the resource
file.

A resource is a piece of data with a specific format that Windows uses
to create the visual and interactive elements of your application.
Most of the visual aspects of Windows applications are the result of
the application having resources, all of which can be created using
the &company Resource Editor. Use the Resource Editor to create and
edit the following resource types:
.begbull $compact
.bull
Accelerators
.bull
Bitmaps
.bull
Cursors
.bull
Dialogs
.bull
Icons
.bull
Menus
.bull
Strings
.endbull
.np
When designing your application's user interface, the resources are
separate from the application's source code. This makes changing the
user interface a simple task. Instead of accessing the application's
source code, you can make the changes directly to the resources. You
can manipulate some aspects of the resources, such as the memory flags
and resource names, without invoking the resource's associated editor.
Invoking the desired editor from the Resource Editor enables you to
change all aspects of the selected resource.
.np
Different applications often use the same or similar resources, such
as bitmaps, icons, dialogs, and menus. The Resource Editor enables you
to create resource files for a new application by reusing existing
resources. Copying a resource from existing applications into the new
resource file makes the task of creating your user interface quick and
simple.
