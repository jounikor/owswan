.np
.ix '&spy'
Most Windows programs are message based. Messages are sent to windows
that programs create and the programs are expected to react to the
messages appropriately.
.np
When a program does not react as expected, you must spend time
debugging the program to find and correct the errors. &spy is a tool
designed to help you debug Windows programs by letting you view the
messages sent to windows in Win16 and Win32 applications. By watching how
a program reacts to the messages it receives, you can isolate the
parts of your code that are causing problems and then make the
required corrections.
.np
With &spy:
.begbull
.bull
you can determine if your window is receiving the messages you expect
it to receive.
.bull
you can verify that your window is receiving messages in the order you
expect.
.bull
novice Windows programmers can become familiar with Windows messages,
by viewing the messages and their parameters.
.endbull
.np
As you run your Windows programs, &spy displays messages in the &spy
window. You control the window using the menu items or the &spy
toolbar.

from the List menu tells &spy to automatically scroll the information
in the message list so that the most recent information written to the
message list always appears on the screen. The Auto Scroll Message List
menu item is checked when this feature is active.
.np
When this feature is deactivated, new messages written to the
message list are added to the bottom of the list and you must use

.section Selecting Messages to Monitor
.*
.np
.ix 'messages' 'watching'
.ix 'messages' 'stopping on'
.ix '&spy' 'selecting messages to monitor'
Each window receives an overwhelming volume of messages. Generally,
you will only be interested in a small subset of these. &spy lets
you limit the messages on which it will report so that you do not have
to sort through all the extraneous data yourself.
.np
&spy maintains two lists of messages: the messages to watch list and
the messages to stop on list.  When spy monitors a message in the
messages to watch list it adds information about that message to
the Message List in the &spy window. When spy monitors a message
in the messages to stop on list it displays a message box reporting
that the message has been encountered and pauses spying operations
until you restart them by selecting Continue Spying from the spy menu.
Any message that does not appear on either list is ignored by &spy.
.np
To modify the messages to watch list choose Messages To Watch from the
Messages menu. To modify the messages to stop on list choose Messages
To Stop On from the Messages menu. In either case, the process of
modifying the list is the same. The rest of this section explains the
dialogs you use to do this.
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section *refid=selinms Selecting Individual Messages
.*
.np
.ix 'messages' 'watching'
.ix 'messages' 'stopping on'
The most precise way to modify the messages to watch or messages to
stop on lists is simply to select a set of individual messages to
appear on the list. To select a set of individual messages to
monitor follow these procedures.
.begstep
.step Choose Messages To Watch or Messages To Stop On
from the Messages Menu.
.result
This opens a Message Class dialog box.  The caption of
the dialog box reflects the menu item selected.
.figure *depth='3.23' *scale=80 *file='spy5' In the Message Class dialog, select the Individual Message Control button.
.step Click on the Individual Message Control button.
.result
This opens a dialog that contains a check box for each message.
.figure *depth='2.55' *scale=52 *file='spy6' In the Message Range dialog, you select the individual messages you want &spy to watch or stop on.
.step Add or remove messages from the list of messages.
.result
A message appears on the selected list if it is checked.
The following buttons are provided for your convenience:
.begnote
.note Clear All
Uncheck all messages on this dialog.
.note Set All
Check all messages on this dialog.
.endnote
.step Choose an action button.
.result
The following buttons allow you to proceed from this dialog:
.begnote
.note Next

range of messages immediately following this one. Changes made
on the current dialog will not be saved until you press the
OK button on some future message range dialog.
.note Prev
Close the current dialog and open the one for the alphabetic
range of messages immediately preceding this one. Changes
made on the current dialog will not be saved until you press
the OK button on some future message range dialog.
.note OK
Close the current dialog and save all changes made in it and
in previous dialog that were exited using the Next or Prev
button.
.note Cancel

and in previous dialog that were exited using the Next or
Prev button.
.endnote
.step Select OK on the Message Class dialog.
.result
The message class dialog closes and your message selections take effect.
If you choose Cancel on the Message Class dialog your message selections
will be discarded.
.endstep
.*
.section *refid=selmscl Selecting Message Classes
.*
.np
Although modifying the list of messages to watch or stop on by
selecting individual messages is more precise, you may find this
process tedious.  To speed up the process several message classes
have been defined for you. These classes group messages by their
function. The messages contained in each message class are listed in
the section entitled :HDREF refid='msgcls'.
.np
Selecting a message class adds all the individual
messages in that class to the selected list.  Similarly,
de-selecting a message class removes all the individual
messages in that class from the selected list.
.np
To select messages to monitor by class follow these procedures:
.begstep
.step Choose Messages To Watch or Messages To Stop On
from the Messages Menu.
.result
This opens a Message Class dialog box.  The caption of
the dialog box reflects the menu item selected.
.ix 'messages' 'watching'
.ix 'messages' 'stopping on'
.figure *depth='3.23' *scale=80 *file='spy5' In the Message class dialog, choose the message classes you want &spy to monitor.
.step Click on the check box
beside the message classes you want to monitor.
.result
A message class is selected when an X appears in the check box. The
following buttons are available for your convenience:
.begnote
.note Clear All
De-select all of the message classes.
.note Set All
Select all of the message classes.
.endnote
.step Click on OK
