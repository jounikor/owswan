.np
The Accelerator Editor enables you to create and edit accelerator
items so you can invoke menu items without using a mouse. Accelerators
define hot keys for menu items in your application. These enhance the
user interface for more advanced users of the application.
.np
Accelerators are keyboard equivalents for menu items, such as Ctrl+S
or F2. For example, many applications associate the accelerator Ctrl+C
with the Copy item in the Edit menu.
.book The Windows Interface: An Application Design Guide
suggests some standard accelerators.
.np
An accelerator item is made up of a key value, menu item identifier,
and flags. These components define the key combination the user
presses to access the specified menu item. The Accelerator Editor
stores the accelerator items in an accelerator table. You can have
multiple accelerator tables for a resource file.
.np
The accelerator editor allows you to create new accelerators and edit
existing accelerators without having to create a resource script or
use a resource compiler. Without the accelerator editor, you would
have to use the resource compiler to add accelerators to your
applications.

.section Adding a New Accelerator Item
.*
.np
.ix 'Accelerator Editor' 'adding a new item'
.ix 'add' 'new Accelerator Item'
The steps for adding a new accelerator item to the accelerator table
are the same, regardless of whether the accelerator table is empty or
already contains accelerator items.
.begstep To add a new accelerator item:
.step Position the cursor in the Key field.
.step Enter the desired key value
that will activate the menu item.
.result
You can enter a single key, such as a letter or number, or a key
sequence. A key sequence may be made up of a modifier and a key, such
as ^k for Ctrl+k.
.step Enter a symbol or numeric identifier
for the menu item
that is activated by the entry in the Key field.
.result
The symbol or numeric identifier you enter here is the identifier
associated with the menu item.
This relationship is defined in the Menu Editor. If you do not
know the desired menu item identifier, open the appropriate menu and
look up the identifier. It is not possible for the Accelerator Editor to
get this information for you.
.step Specify ASCII or Virtual Key
in the Key Type section of the window.
.begnote
.note ASCII Keys
.ix 'ASCII keys'
When the Key Type specified is ASCII, keys you press appear as
characters, such as
.us a, B, 2,
or
.us $.
In the Key field, the ASCII characters are surrounded by quotation
marks. For example,
.us c
appears as
.us "c"
and
.us Ctrl+C
appears as
.us "^C".
When using ASCII characters as accelerators, you may combine them with
the Ctrl key to form key sequences, such as Ctrl+X or Ctrl+P. There is
no symbol to represent the Shift key in ASCII. Applying the Shift key
with an ASCII character results in an upper case character in the Key
field. For example,
.us Shift+d
appears as
.us "D".
:cmt. To apply the Alt key to an ASCII character, mark the appropriate check
:cmt. box in the Modifiers section of the attributes area.
.note Virtual Keys
.ix 'Virtual Keys'
When the Key Type specified is Virtual Key, you enter the standard
Windows identifier for the desired key. For example, the Windows
identifier for the Home key is
.us VK_HOME.
The header file WINDOWS.H defines these identifiers. To avoid looking
up these identifiers yourself, use the Key Value function explained in
the section
.us Editing the Key Value.
:cmt. There is no virtual key equivalent for the Alt, Ctrl,
:cmt. and Shift keys.
To specify whether the Alt, Ctrl, or Shift keys must be pressed with
another key to form a key sequence, mark the appropriate check box in
the Modifiers section of the attributes area.
.endnote
.step Select the desired modifiers
in the Modifiers section.
.result
Modifiers are flags indicating keys that you must press in addition to
the specified key value to activate the menu item. When the ASCII
option is selected, the Control and Shift modifiers are not available.
.step Press the Insert action button
.orstep Choose Insert New Item
from the Accelerator menu.
.orstep Select the Insert New Item button on the toolbar.
.result
The Accelerator Editor adds the new accelerator item to the
accelerator table. When accelerator items exist in the accelerator
table, one item is always selected. Choosing the Insert New Item menu
item or button positions the new accelerator item directly after the
selected accelerator item in the list.
