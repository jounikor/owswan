The following command descriptions show items within angle brackets (&lt.&gt.).
The angle brackets are there to indicate items that you may supply.
You are not required to type the brackets.
For example, <filename> simply means that in the corresponding place
in the command you should enter the name of a file.
For example, <filename> may be replaced with
.millust begin
   test.c
.millust end
and the brackets are not entered.
.np
The command descriptions also show items inside double quotes (").
The double quotes are used to indicate a literal option that you may supply.
You are not required to type the quotes.
For example, "-c" indicates that in the corresponding place in the command
you may enter
.param -c
.period
.np
In the syntax model for each command, the upper-case characters represent
the minimal truncation of the command.
