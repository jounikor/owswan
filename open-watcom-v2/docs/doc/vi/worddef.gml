A word is defined
using the
.keyref word
setting. The default is that any characters in the set (
.var _
.ct ,
.var a-z
.ct ,
.var A-Z
.ct ,
.var 0-9
) are considered part of a word,
and all other characters (except for whitespace) are delimiters.  Groups
of delimiters are considered to be a word as well.
