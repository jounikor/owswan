The &edname is a modal editor.
When you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
(the default mode), there are a number of valid keys that may be pressed.
To ensure that you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , press the
.param ESC
key until the mode indicator
on the menu bar displays:
.millust begin
Mode: command
.millust end
.np
When in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , text may be entered.
There are two aspects to
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct :
.keyword insert
and
.keyword overstrike
.period
.keyword &tinsmode
is entered via a number of different commands from
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , and is indicated by a larger cursor, along with a mode line indication.
The types of cursor are controlled with the
.keyref commandcursortype
.ct ,
.keyref insertcursortype
.ct , and
.keyref overstrikecursortype
settings.
.np
When &edvi is in a
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , the mode indicator on the menu bar displays one of:
.millust begin
Mode: insert
.millust end
or
.millust begin
Mode: overstrike
.millust end
.* ******************************************************************
.section *refid=timode 'Text Insertion Mode'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
When in
.keyword &tinsmode
(either inserting or overstriking), you may enter text and freely cursor
about through the file.
When you are finished adding text, the
.param ESC
key returns you to
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.np
It should be remembered that an undo applies to
changes caused by commands; so all changes made while in
.keyword &tinsmode
are part of a single undo record.
For more information on undos, see the section
:HDREF refid='cmundo'.
later on in this chapter.

.section 'Command Mode'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
The following
.keyword &cmdmode
command descriptions show items within angle brackets (&lt.&gt.).
The angle brackets are there to indicate items that you may supply.
You are not required to type the brackets.
For example, &lt.n&gt. simply means that in the corresponding place
in the command you can enter a number.
.np
Many commands may be preceded with a repeat count, which is
indicated by a
.paramt n
before a command.
The number is not required; if it is not supplied, it is usually assumed
that a 1 was entered for the repeat count.
As long as the setting
.keyref repeatinfo
is enabled, the number that is typed appears in a special window called the
.keyref countwindow
.period
.np
Other commands may be preceded with a
.keyword &copybuffer
name, which is indicated with a
.paramt "?
.period
If you do not want the result of the operation to be copied into the
active
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct , then an alternate buffer may be specified.
The double quotes (")
are required (this indicates that an alternate buffer is being specified),
and then a buffer '1'-'9' or 'a'-'z' is specified.
See the section
:HDREF refid='cpybuff'.
for more information.

.section *refid=cmundo 'Undoing Changes'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
&edvi keeps an undo history of all changes made to an edit buffer.
There is no limit on the number of undos, as long as there is enough
memory to save the undo information.
If there is not enough memory to save undo information for the current
action, then the oldest undo information is removed until enough memory
has been released.
.np
There is also an undo-undo (redo) history:  as you issue undo commands,
the information to redo the undo is kept.
However, once you modify the file other than by doing an undo, the redo
history is lost.
.np
As you issue undo commands, a message indicating how many undos are remaining.
The message could look like:

.millust begin
16 items left on undo stack
.millust end

This lets you know how many undos it would take to restore the
edit buffer to its original condition.
Once there are no more undos, you will see the message:

.millust begin
undo stack is empty
.millust end

Once you undo all changes,
then the file changes state from modified to unmodified.
However, if some undo changes have had to be discarded because of low memory,
the file will still be in a modified state.
.np
The keystrokes for doing undo and redo are:
.*
.keylist begin 'Undoing Changes'
.*
.begkey u u

.section *refid=cpybuff 'Copy Buffers'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
A
.keyword &copybuffer
is a buffer where copied or deleted data is kept.
There are a number of these buffers available.
There are 9 default buffers that text is placed into when it is deleted/yanked
(see the
.keyword &cmdline
commands
.keyref delete
and
.keyref yank
.ct , along with the sections
:HDREF refid='deltext'.
and
:HDREF refid='cpytext'.
later in this chapter).
These buffers are numbered 1 through 9, and any of these buffers may be
the active
.keyword &copybuffer
.period
.np
The active
.keyword &copybuffer
may be selected using function keys.
CTRL_F1 through CTRL_F9 select buffers 1 through 9 respectively.
When a buffer is selected, information about its contents is displayed in
the message window.
This buffer becomes the active
.keyword &copybuffer
.period
All yanked/deleted text is copied into this buffer.
.np
When text is yanked/deleted into the active
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct , the contents of the the buffers are cascaded forward from the active
buffer into the next one, with the last numbered
.keyword &copybuffer
losing its contents.
Any buffers that are before the active
.keyword &copybuffer
have their contents preserved.
For example, if buffer 3 is the active
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct , then a deletion will cascade buffer 3 to buffer 4, buffer 4 to buffer 5,
and so on, with the contents of buffer 9 being lost.
Buffers 1 and 2 remain untouched, and buffer 3 gets a copy of the deleted text.
.np
There are several
.keyword &cmdmode
commands that add text to buffers; they are
.*
:DL break.
.*
:DT.&lt."?&gt.&lt.n&gt.d&lt.oper&gt.
:DD.Deletes text in various ways.

:DT.&lt.n&gt.DEL
:DD.Deletes the character at the current cursor position.

:DT.D
:DD.Deletes text from the current cursor position to the end of the current line.

:DT.&lt.n&gt.x
:DD.Deletes the character at the current cursor position.

:DT.&lt.n&gt.X
:DD.Deletes the character before the current cursor position.

:DT.&lt."?&gt.&lt.n&gt.y&lt.oper&gt.
:DD.Yanks (copies) text in various ways.

:DT.&lt.n&gt.Y
:DD.Yanks (copies) the current line.

Text may be yanked/deleted into a specific

As well, there are 26 named buffers that may be used, 'a'-'z'.
When text is yanked or deleted into a named buffer,

Search strings may be up to 512 bytes in length; the search string window
scrolls.

The search string window has a history associated with it; the size
of this search string history is controlled using the
