:DD.Any special key may be inserted for
.param "key"
.period

There are a number of pre-defined keys symbols that are recognized.
These are described in the Appendix
:HDREF refid='symkey'.
.period

:DT.\e
:DD.Short form for the escape key (rather than \&lt.ESC&gt.).

:DT.\n
:DD.Short form for the enter key (rather than \&lt.ENTER&gt.).

:DT.\h
:DD.If a
.keyword &cmdline
command is used in the sequence, and it follows the colon (':'),
the command is not added to the history.
For example:
.millust begin
:\hdate\n
.millust end
will display the current date and time, but the command will not enter
the command history.

:DT.\x
:DD.If a
.keyword &cmdline
command is used in the sequence, then this stops the command window
from opening.
This prevents the "flashing" of the command window as it is opened
then closed.
For example:
.millust begin
\x:date\n
.millust end
will display the current date and time, but the command window will
not be displayed.
