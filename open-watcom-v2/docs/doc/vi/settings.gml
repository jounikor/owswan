This chapter describes the various options that may be controlled using
the &edname.'s
.keyref set
command.
Options are typically set in the
.keyword configuration script
.ct ; however, options are settable at execution time as well.
.np
If you know the option you wish to set, you may just issue the
.keyref set
command directly at the command prompt, e.g.:
.millust begin
set nocaseignore
set autosaveinterval=10
.millust end
.np
A boolean option is set in the following way:
.millust begin
set autoindent   - turns on autoindent
set noautoindent - turns off autoindent
.millust end
Short forms may also be used; for example:
.millust begin
set ai   - turns on autoindent
set noai - turns off autoindent
.millust end
.np
A non-boolean option may be set in the following way:
.millust begin
set filename=test.c  - sets current filename to 'test.c'
set filename test2.c - sets current filename to 'test2.c'
.millust end
Note that the assignment operator '=' is optional.
.np
If you do not know the boolean option you wish to set, you may issue the
set command with no option at the command prompt, e.g.:
.millust begin
set
.millust end
This will cause a menu of all possible settings to appear.
These values may be changed by either cursoring to the desired one and
pressing enter, or by double clicking on the desired one with the mouse.
Boolean settings will toggle between TRUE and FALSE.
Selecting any other setting will cause a window to pop up, displaying
the old value and prompting you for the new value.
This window may be cancelled by pressing the ESC key.
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi031' '&edvi Settings Selection list'
.np
When you are finished with the settings menus, you may close the window
by pressing the
.keyword ESC
key.

.*
.setcmd *short=ai autoindent
.setsyntx
.begdescr
In
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , &cmd_long causes the cursor to move to
start of previous line when a new line is started.
In
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , &cmd_long causes the cursor to go to the first non
white-space when ENTER is pressed.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=ac automessageclear
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Automatically erases the message window when a key is typed in
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=bf beepflag
.setsyntx
.begdescr
&edvi normally beeps when an error is encountered.
Setting &nocmd_long disables the beeping.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=ci caseignore
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Causes all searches to be case insensitive if set.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=cv changelikevi
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If set, then the change command behaves like UNIX &edvi, i.e.
if ESC is pressed when no change has been made, the text is deleted.
Normally, pressing ESC cancels the change without deleting the text.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=cm cmode
.setsyntx
.begdescr
When cmode is set, certain things will happen when you are entering text:
:UL.
:LI.After entering a line ending in '{', the next line will be indented a
.keyref shiftwidth
further than the current one.
:LI.After entering a line ending in '}', the current line is shifted
to match the indentation of the line with the matching '{'.
The cursor will flash for a brief instant on the matching '{' if
.keyref showmatch 1
is set.
:LI.All lines entered will have trailing white space trimmed off.
:LI."case" and "default" statements are shifted to be aligned with switch
statements.
:eUL.
.np
Each file has its own &cmd_long. setting; so setting &cmd_long in one file
and not in another (during the same editing session) will work.
.np
One thing that is useful is to add the following lines to your read
.keyword hook script
.ct :
.millust begin
    if %E == .c
        set cmode
    else
        set nocmode
    endif
.millust end
This will cause cmode to be set if the file has a .c extension, and not
to be set for any other type of file.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=cs columninfilestatus
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Causes the current column to be added to file status display
(obtained when typing CTRL_G).
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=ct currentstatus
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Enables the display of the current status on the menu bar.
The position on the menu bar is controlled with
.keyref currentstatuscolumn
.period
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=dt drawtildes
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If &cmd_long is true, then the all lines displayed that do not have any
data associated with them will have a tilde ('&tilde.') displayed on the line.
If &cmd_long is false, then no tidles will be displayed and the string
.keyref  fileendstring
will be displayed after the last line with data.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=eb eightbits
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If &cmd_long is set, then all characters are displayed as normal.
If &nocmd_long is set then non-printable ASCII will be displayed
as control characters.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=em escapemessage
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Display the current file status whenever the
.keyword ESC
key is pressed in
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=xm extendedmemory
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If &cmd_long is set, extended memory is used if it is present
(standard extended, EMS, XMS).
This option applies to the real-mode DOS version of &edvi only.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=iz ignorectrlz
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Normally, a CTRL_Z in a file acts as an end-of-file indicator.
Setting &cmd_long causes &edvi to treat CTRL_Z as just
another character in the file.
This option may also be selected using the '-z' option
when invoking &edvi..
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=it ignoretagcase
.setsyntx
.begdescr
When using the "-t" command line option of &edvi, the tag that is matched
is normally case sensitive.
Setting &cmd_long causes the tag matching to be case insensitive.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=ma magic
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If &cmd_long is set, then all special characters in a regular expression
are treated as "magic", and must be escaped to be used in an ordinary fashion.
If &nocmd_long is set, then any special characters in
.keyref  magicstring
are NOT treated as magic characters by the regular expression
handler, and must be escaped to have special meaning.
.np
Magic characters are:
.mono ^$.[()|?+*\~@
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=ps pauseonspawnerr
.setsyntx
.begdescr
This option, if set, causes &edvi to pause after spawning (running
a system command)
if there was an error, even if the system command was spawned from a script.
Normally, a command spawned from a script
does not pause when control returns to the editor.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=qu quiet
.setsyntx
.begdescr
When running in quiet mode, &edvi does not update the screen.
This is useful when running a complex script, so that the activity of the
editor is hidden.
This option may be selected when invoking
&edvi by using the '-q' switch, causing &edvi to run in a 'batch mode'.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=qf quitmovesforward
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If this option is set, then when a file is quit, the next file in the list
of files is moved to.
Otherwise, the previous file in the list of files is moved to.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=rf readentirefile
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If &cmd_long is set, then the entire file is read into memory when
it is edited.
This is the default setting.
However, if &nocmd_long is set, then the file is only read into memory
as it is needed.
This option is useful when you only want to look at the first few pages
of a large file.
This option may be selected when invoking &edvi by using the '-n' switch.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=rc readonlycheck
.setsyntx
.begdescr
This option causes &edvi to complain about modifications to
read-only files every time the file is modified.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=rt realtabs
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If &nocmd_long is set, then tabs are expanded to spaces when the
file is read.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=rm regsubmagic
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If &nocmd_long is set, then escaped characters have no meaning
in regular expression substitution expressions.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=sc samefilecheck
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Normally, &edvi just warns you if you edit a file twice
(with a different path).
If &cmd_long is set, then if you edit a file that is the same as a file
already being edited (only you specified a different path), then that file will be brought up, rather
than a new copy being read in.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short='sn' saveconfig
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If this option is set, then the editor's configuration (fonts, colors,
settings, etc) is saved when the editor is exited.
.np
&guionly
.enddescr

.setcmd *short='so' saveposition
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If this option is set, then the editor's position and size is saved
when the editor is exited, and restored the next time the editor
is started.
.np
&guionly
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=sw searchwrap
.setsyntx
.begdescr
When searching a file, &edvi normally wraps around the top or bottom
of the file.   If &nocmd_long is set, then &edvi terminates its searches
once it reaches the top or bottom of the file.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=sm showmatch
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If &cmd_long is set, the &edvi briefly moves the cursor to a matching '('
whenever a ')' is typed while entering text.  Also, the matching '{' is
shown if a '}' is typed if
.keyref cmode 1
is set.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=tp tagprompt
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If a more than one instance of a tag is found in the tags file, a
list of choices is displayed if &cmd_long is set.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=un undo
.ix 'undo setting'
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Setting &nocmd_long disables &edvi's undo ability.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=ve verbose
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If enabled, this option causes &edvi to display extra messages
while doing involved processing.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=ww wordwrap
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If enabled, word movement commands ('w','W','b','B') will wrap
to the next or previous line.
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=ws wrapbackspace
.setsyntx
.begdescr
If this option is set, pressing backspace while on column one of
a line will cause &edvi to wrap to the end of the previous line
(while in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct ).
.enddescr

.setcmd *short=wl writecrlf
.setsyntx
.begdescr
Normally, lines are written with carriage return and line feeds at the
end of each line.  If &nocmd_long is set, the lines are written
with only a line feed at the end.
