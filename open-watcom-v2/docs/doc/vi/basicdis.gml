You have now made a number of significant modifications to your file.
To discard the file without saving your changes,
activate the individual file menu (at the top-left corner of the
edit window) either by clicking on the gadget character with the mouse or by
pressing
.param ALT_G.
When the menu is up, try selecting the
.keyword Close
item.  You will get the message:
.millust begin
File modified - use :q! to force
.millust end
The command ":q!" being referred to will be discussed later.  The
file can be exited without saving by using the
.keyword Close no save
menu item.  Activate the individual file menu again, and select this
item.  This will discard your changes to the file, and since you
are not editing any other files, you are returned to the operating system
command prompt.
