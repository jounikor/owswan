.chap *refid=basic 'Basic Usage'
.np
Using any editor as powerful as &edvi takes some practice.
This chapter will lead you through the basics or using &edvi..
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Starting the &edname.'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
&edvi is invoked by typing the command
.millust begin
vi
.millust end
at the command prompt.
Try typing this.
You will see something similar to the following:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi001' The &edvi screen
.np
&edvi also accepts one or more files as an optional parameter.
Each file that you specify will be edited by &edvi..
For example, typing
.millust begin
vi test.c
.millust end
will edit the file
.mono test.c
.period
Typing
.millust begin
vi test.c other.c
.millust end
will edit the files
.mono test.c
and
.mono other.c
.period
Typing
.millust begin
vi *.c
.millust end
will edit all files that have the extension
.mono .c
.period
.np
:INCLUDE file='exitvi'.
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'What is a Modal Editor?'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
A modal editor is one where keystrokes have different meaning, depending
on what mode you are in.
&edvi has two main modes,
.keyword &cmdmode
and
.keyword &tinsmode
.period
.np
While in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , pressing a key on your keyboard can cause something
different to happen.
For example, pressing the letter D (capital 'd') deletes all characters from
the current cursor position to the end of the line.
If the same letter 'D' (is pressed while in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , the letter 'D' appears in your text (much as you would expect).
.np
It is easy to tell what mode you are in while using &edvi..
When you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , the cursor is a thin line.
When you are in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , the cursor is much thicker: if you are inserting
text, the cursor is one half of a full block, and if you are overstriking
text, the cursor is a full block.
.np
The mode indicator on the menu bar at the
top of your screen shows the current mode.
While in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , you will see the following:
.millust begin
Mode: command
.millust end
While in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , you will see either:
.millust begin
Mode: insert
.millust end
or
.millust begin
Mode: overstrike
.millust end
depending on whether you are inserting or overstriking text.
.np
&edvi is in
.keyword &cmdmode
by default.
There are numerous ways to enter
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , the easiest of which is to press the
.param INS
key on your keyboard.
.np
The
.param ESC
key is one of the more important keys in &edvi..
Pressing
.param ESC
once will stop whatever you are doing and
return you to
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
If you have started a
.keyword &cmdmode
sequence, pressing
.param ESC
will cancel the command and return you to
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.exercises
Start up &edvi by typing
.millust begin
vi
.millust end
at your command prompt.
.np
You will see a screen that looks like the following:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi001' The &edvi screen
.np
Press the
.param INS
key.
The cursor will get larger and you will see the mode indicator change from
.millust begin
Mode: command
.millust end
to
.millust begin
Mode: insert
.millust end
Try typing some characters.
Notice that they appear in the edit window as you type.
When you are done, press the
.param ESC
key.
The cursor will get smaller and you will see the mode indicator change from
.millust begin
Mode: insert
.millust end
to
.millust begin
Mode: command
.millust end
.np
:INCLUDE file='exitvi'.
.np
Once you exit, you will be prompted with a message as follows:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi003' The Really Exit prompt
there are still files that have been modified but not saved.
Press 'n' then the
.param ENTER
key to exit without saving your current file.
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Some Basic Commands'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
To begin editing with &edvi, there are only a few basic commands
that you need to learn.
Once you master these few commands, you will be able to accomplish
all basic editing tasks.
In later chapters, more sophisticated commands will be introduced which
allow advanced tasks to be completed more quickly.
.*

.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Moving Around'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
When you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , you may move around in your text using various cursor keys.
The basic keys that you use to move around are:
:INCLUDE file='basicmv'.
.np
These same cursor keys may also be used when entering text in
.keyword &tinsmode
.period
.* ******************************************************************
.section *refid=savexit 'Saving and Exiting a File'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
Once you have modified a file, may want to save it and either edit other
files or exit the editor.
When you exit a modified file, you may want to either discard your changes
or keep them.
.np
You can discard ALL of your files by selecting the
.keyword Exit
item in the
.keyword File
menu.
Alternatively, you can discard or save the changes on an individual file basis.
.np
If you wish to save the current file you are editing and leave that
particular edit session, the fastest way to do it is to use the command 'ZZ'.
Press
.param ESC
to make sure that you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , and then type two capital z's ('ZZ') in a row.
This saves the file, then exits the edit buffer for the file.
If you are editing any other files, the next one in the list will become
the current one.
If you are not editing any other files, then &edvi will exit.
.np
You may use certain menu items to save or discard changes to your file.
The main menu option
.keyword File
(by clicking on it with the mouse or by pressing
.param ALT_F
.ct ) has options for saving the current file.
As well, each edit window has a menu associated with it that you can access
by pressing
.param ALT_G
.period
You can also access this menu by clicking on the gadget character in the top left hand
corner of an edit window.
This menu has a number of choices for dealing with the file.
.np
If you activate the
.keyword File
menu item, either with the mouse or by pressing
.param ALT_F,
a menu will be displayed as follows:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi004' The File Menu
.np
If you select the
.keyword Save current file
item, &edvi will save the current file you are editing.
You will remain editing the current file.
.np
If you select the
.keyword Save current file and close
item, &edvi will save the current file you are editing, and
close the edit window.
If you are editing any other files, the next one in the list will become
the current one.
If you are not editing any other files, then &edvi will exit.
.np
If you activate the individual file menu either by clicking on the gadget
character at the top-left corner of the edit window
with the mouse or by pressing
.param ALT_G
.ct , then a menu will pop up as follows:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi005' The Individual Edit Window menu
.np
If you select the
.keyword Save current file
item, &edvi will save the current file you are editing.
You will remain editing the current file.
.np
If you select the
.keyword Save & close
item, &edvi will save the current file you are editing, and exit that edit
buffer.
If you are editing any other files, the next one in the list will become
the current one.
If you are not editing any other files, then &edvi will exit.
.np
If you select the
.keyword Close no save
item, &edvi will discard the current file without saving your modifications.
If you are editing any other files, the next one in the list will become
the current one.
If you are not editing any other files, then &edvi will exit.
.np
If you select the
.keyword Close
item, &edvi will try to discard the current file.
However, if the file has been modified, then the option will fail.
.* ******************************************************************
.section *refid=intext 'Inputting Text'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
You have already learned that pressing the
.param INS
key while in
.keyword &cmdmode
puts &edvi into insert mode.
Once you are in insert mode, you may enter whatever text you like.
You may cursor around and modify your text in whatever way you choose.
Once you are done, you may press the
.param ESC
key to return to
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.np
While you are in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , the basic keys that allow you to move through the text are:
:INCLUDE file='basicmv'.
.np
These keys allow you to manipulate the text while in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct :
.*
:DL break.

:DT.CTRL_DEL (Control-Delete)
:DD.Deletes the current line.

:DT.BS (Backspace key)
:DD.Deletes the character before the cursor, moving the cursor and the
rest of the line to the left one character.

:DT.DEL (Delete key)
:DD.Delete the character under the cursor.
If you are at the end of the line,
.param DEL
has the same effect as pressing
.param BS.

:DT.ENTER
:DD.Start a new line.

:DT.INS (Insert key)
:DD.Toggles between inserting and overstriking text.

:eDL.
.*
.np
Along with the
.param INS
key, there are a number of other keys that you can press in
.keyword &cmdmode
that will place you in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , where you can edit text.
The difference between all of these commands is where the cursor moves
to before you start inputting text.
The basic set of keys is:
.*
:DL compact.

:DT.a
:DD.Starts appending (inserting) text after the current character.

:DT.A
:DD.Starts appending (inserting) text after the last character on the
current line.

:DT.i
:DD.Starts inserting text at the current cursor position.
This is the same as pressing the
.param INS
key.

:DT.I
:DD.Starts inserting text before the first non-white space character on
the current line.

:DT.o
:DD.Adds a blank line after the current line, and starts you inserting text
on the new line.

:DT.O
:DD.Adds a blank line before the current line, and starts you inserting text
on the new line.

:DT.R
:DD.Starts overstriking text at the current cursor position.

:DT.INS
:DD.Start inserting text at the current cursor position.

:eDL.
.*
.np
Remember, while in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , the following mode indicator will appear
on the menu bar:
.millust begin
Mode: insert
.millust end
or
.millust begin
Mode: overstrike
.millust end
depending on whether you are inserting or overstriking text.
As well, the cursor will change to a larger block cursor
to help you remember that you are are inputting text.
.np
To exit
.keyword &tinsmode
at any time, press the
.param ESC
key.
Your mode indicator will switch to
.millust begin
Mode: command
.millust end
.*
.exercises
:OL.

:LI.Edit a new file (called "test", for example) as follows:
.millust begin
vi test
.millust end
You will see the following screen:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi006' Editing the New File "test"
Note the message window (the bottom two lines of the screen)
contains the message
.millust begin
"test" [new file] line 1 of 1  -- 100% --
.millust end
This message indicates that you are editing a new file called
test, that you are on line 1 of a 1 line file, and that line 1 is
100% of the way into the file.
.np
You may see that message any time by pressing
.param CTRL_G
(hold down the Ctrl key and press the g key).
.np
Enter
.keyword &tinsmode
by pressing the
.param INS
key, and type the following lines:
.millust begin
This is a test line.
This is another test line.
.millust end
When you are done typing these lines, remember to press the
.param ESC
key to return to
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.np
Press
.param CTRL_G
(hold down Ctrl and press the g key).
The message window (the bottom two lines of the screen)
will show the message:
.millust begin
"test" [modified] line 2 of 2  -- 100% --
.millust end
.np
Now, press two capital z's in a row ('ZZ').
This will save the file and return to the operating system command prompt.
:LI.Edit the file you created in the previous example, by typing
.millust begin
vi test
.millust end
You will see the following screen:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi007' Editing the File "test"
Note the message window (the bottom two lines of the screen)
contains the message
.millust begin
"test" line 1 of 2  -- 50% --
.millust end
This message is different than when you edited "test" for the first time.
The "[new file]" indicator is gone, since you have edited an existing file.
This message indicates to you that you are now editing a file called
test, that you are on line 1 of a 2 line file, and that line 1 is
50% of the way into the file.
.np
Now try to experiment with the different ways of entering insert mode.
:OL.

:LI.Try pressing the 'A'(capital 'a') key.
This will move your cursor to the end of the line, and will put you into
insert mode.
Try adding some text to this line, and press the
.param ESC
key when you are done.

:LI.Try pressing the 'I' key.
This will move your cursor to the start of the line, and will put you into
insert mode.
Try adding some text to this line, and press the
.param ESC
key when you are done.

:LI.Try pressing the 'R' key.
This will start you in overstrike mode.
Note that the you have a very large cursor and that the mode indicator says:
.millust begin
Mode: overstrike
.millust end
Try typing some characters.
As you type, what was there already is replaced by what you type.
Press the
.param ESC
key when you are done.

:LI.Try pressing the 'i' key.
This is the same as pressing the
.param INS
key.
Now type some text, then press the
.param INS
key.
Note that your cursor turned to full height from half height, and the mode
indicator changed from:
.millust begin
Mode: insert
.millust end
to
.millust begin
Mode: overstrike
.millust end
Now, when you type, you will replace the existing characters.
Try pressing the
.param INS
key again.
This time, your cursor will turn from full height to half height, and
the mode indicator will change from:
.millust begin
Mode: overstrike
.millust end
to
.millust begin
Mode: insert
.millust end
Remember to press the
.param ESC
key when you are done.

:LI.Try pressing the 'a' key.
This will move the cursor over one character, and put you in insert mode.
Try cursoring around inside your text using the arrow keys.
Use the
.param END
key to move to the end of a line, and the
.param HOME
key to move to the start of a line.
Press the

.section *refid=scap 'Cutting and Pasting Text'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
So far, you have learned how to edit a file, input some text, and
save or cancel your changes.
Now you will learn some simple ways of deleting text and moving it elsewhere.
.*
.beglevel
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Lines'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
The section
:HDREF refid='intext'.
noted that pressing
.param CTRL_DEL
(control-delete) deleted a line when inputting text.
This same command can be used while in
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.np
If you want to delete more than one line at once, you may precede
this delete command with a
.keyword repeat count
.period
You enter a repeat count
simply by typing numbers before you press
.param CTRL_DEL
.period
As you type a number in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , it will appear in a special window,
as follows:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi008' Repeat Count Display
The number that you are typing is displayed in the repeat count window.
As with all
.keyword &cmdmode
commands, if you decide that you have made a mistake,
just press the
.param ESC
key and the count you have been typing will be cancelled.
.np
So, if you type a repeat count of 5 and then press
.param CTRL_DEL
.ct , five lines will be deleted.
If you do not type a repeat count, then one line will be deleted.
.np
You can also delete a line by pressing the 'd' key twice in a row ('dd').
This has the exact same effect as pressing the
.param CTRL_DEL
key.
You may precede this command by a repeat count as well.
For example, typing
.millust begin
12dd
.millust end
deletes the next 12 lines in your file.
.np
Once you have deleted some lines, you might want to paste them back in.
If you press
.param SHIFT_INS
(shift insert),
the line(s) you deleted will be pasted in after the current line.
If you press
.param CTRL_INS
(control insert),
the line(s) you deleted will be pasted in before the current line (which
reverses the action of
.param CTRL_DEL
.ct ).
.np
There are two other keys for pasting, the letters 'p' and 'P'
(small p and capital p).
Small 'p' pastes the line(s) you deleted after the current line, just like
.param SHIFT_INS
.period
Capital p ('P') pastes the line(s) you deleted before the current line,
just like
.param CTRL_INS
.period
.np
If you do not wish to delete some lines, but you do wish to copy them
so you can paste them somewhere else, then you may use the "yank" command.
If you press the letter 'Y', or type the letters 'yy', you will "yank"
(make a copy of) the current line.
Just like 'dd' or
.param CTRL_DEL,
you can precede these commands with a repeat count.
For example, typing
.millust begin
6Y
.millust end
or
.millust begin
6yy
.millust end
will copy 6 lines in your file.
.np
Once you have yanked the lines, you may paste them in, as discussed above.
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Characters'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
To delete characters while in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , you can press the
.param DEL
key or the 'x' key.
The current character under the cursor will be deleted.
You may type a repeat count before you type
.param DEL
or 'x',
and that will delete a number of characters.
For example, typing
.mono 3x
when the cursor is on 'T' in the line
.millust begin
Delete Test.
.millust end
will leave you with
.millust begin
Delete t.
.millust end
and the cursor will be on the 't' just before the period.
.np
If you wish to delete the character before the cursor, you may
press the letter 'X' (capital x).
This will delete the character before the cursor, and move
the cursor back one (i.e. the cursor stays on the character that
it was on before you pressed the 'X').
You may use a repeat count with this command.
For example, typing
.mono 3X
when the cursor is on 'T' in the line
.millust begin
Delete Test.
.millust end
will leave you with
.millust begin
DeleTest.
.millust end
and the cursor will still be on the 'T'.
.np
Once you have deleted some characters, you might want to paste them back in.
The keys involved are the exact same keys for pasting lines.
The difference is that when you paste characters, the characters are pasted
into the current line, whereas when you paste lines, the lines are pasted
above or below the current line.
.np
If you press
.param SHIFT_INS
(shift insert), the character(s) you deleted will be pasted in after
the current cursor position on the current line.
If you press
.param CTRL_INS
(control insert), the character(s) you deleted will be pasted in before
the current cursor position on the current line.
.np
There are two other keys for pasting, the letters
.param p
and
.param P
(small p and capital p).
Small p pastes the character(s) you deleted after the current cursor position
on the current line, just like
.param SHIFT_INS
.period
Capital p ('P') pastes the character(s) you deleted before the cursor position
on the current line, just like
.param CTRL_INS
.period
.*
