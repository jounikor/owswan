.keyword menu bar
which contains all of the menu choices, the current mode, and the current
time.

Other edit windows are usually covered by the current edit window, unless
you change the size and position of the edit windows.

.keyword status window

These special symbols are referred to as
.keyword gadgets

:UL.

:LI.In the top left corner of the edit window is the gadget character that opens
up the menu for the window.

:LI.In the lower right corner of the edit window is the resize gadget character.
When you click on this gadget character with your mouse and then drag the mouse,
you can resize the edit window.

:LI.On the right hand side of the edit window is the scroll bar.
The scroll bar has several components:

:LI.The scroll up gadget character.
When you click on this with your mouse, the edit window scrolls up one line.

:LI.The scroll down gadget character.
When you click on this with your mouse, the edit window scrolls down one line.

:LI.The scroll thumb character.
The scroll thumb indicates the relative position of the current line in the file.
When you click on the scroll thumb with your mouse and drag it,
you can move to a new position in the file.
If you click with your mouse on the scroll bar above the scroll thumb,
you move one page up in the file.
If you click on the scroll bar below the scroll thumb, you move one page
down in the file.
