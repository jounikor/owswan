This chapter discusses a number of the less commonly used features of the &edname..
The knowledge of the information in the chapter
:HDREF page=no refid='basic'.
and
:HDREF page=no refid='inter'.
is assumed.
.*
.section 'The Substitute Command'
.*
.np
The
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref substitute
is a powerful mechanism for changing text in your file.
For every match of a string, the string can be replaced with something else.
.np
:INCLUDE file='rxexp'.
.np
The syntax of the
.keyref substitute
command is:
.millust begin
&lt.line_range&gt. substitute /&lt.string&gt./&lt.subs&gt./"g""i"
.millust end
.np
The line range
.paramt line_range
specifies the lines that the
.keyref substitute
command is to work on.
If no line range is specified, then the current line is assumed.
.np
The first occurrence of the search string
.paramt string
on each line is replaced with the string
.paramt subs
.period
.np
If the letter 'g' is specified at the end, then every occurrence
of the search string
.paramt string
on each line is replaced with the string
.paramt subs
.period
.np
If the letter 'i' is specified at the end, then the substitution is
interactive.
You will be prompted before each replacement to verify that you want
it to be done.

.section 'The Global Command'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
The
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref global
is a method of executing a command on every line that has (or does not have)
a specific string.
.np
:INCLUDE file='rxexp'.
.np
The syntax of the
.keyref global
command is:
.millust begin
&lt.line_range&gt. global "!" /&lt.string&gt./ &lt.cmd&gt.
.millust end
.np
The line range
.paramt line_range
specifies the lines that the
.keyref global
command is to work on.
If no line range is specified, then all the lines in the file is assumed.
.np
The
.keyword &cmdline
command
.paramt cmd
will be executed on every line that has the string
.paramt string
.period
.np
If the exclamation mark ('!') is used, then the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.paramt cmd
will be executed on every line that does not have the string
.paramt string

.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Searching Files For Text'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
There are
.keyword &cmdline
commands provided to search through all files for some text.
These commands differ from the search commands outlined in the section
:HDREF refid='stext'.
in the previous chapter in that they search files in directories rather
than files that are being edited.
These file search commands are
.keyref fgrep
and
.keyref egrep
.period
.np
The
.keyref fgrep
command is a fast search for a specified string.
The syntax of this command is:
.millust begin
fgrep "-c" "-i" &lt.string&gt. &lt.files&gt..
.millust end
The file list
.paramt files
is searched for the string
.paramt string
.period
The file list may contain wild cards.
.np
If you wish to have spaces in your string, then you can enclose the
string in either double quotes ('"') or forward slashes ('/').
.np
If
.param -c
is specified, then the search is made case sensitive.
If
.param -i
is specified, then the search is made case insensitive.
If neither of these options is specified, then case sensitivity is determined
by the current
.keyref caseignore 1
setting (for more information about
.keyref caseignore 1
.ct , see the section
:HDREF refid='boolset'.
in the chapter
:HDREF page=no refid='edset'.
.ct ).
.np
The
.keyref egrep
command searches for regular expressions, and is slower than the
.keyref fgrep
command.
The syntax of this command is:
.millust begin
egrep &lt.regexp&gt. &lt.files&gt..
.millust end
The file list
.paramt files
is searched for the regular expression
.paramt regexp
.period
The file list may contain wild cards.
.np
If you wish to have spaces in your regular expression, then you can enclose
the string in either double quotes ('"') or forward slashes ('/').
.np
For example, entering the following command:
.millust begin
:fgrep window *.c
.millust end
searches all files in the current directory ending in the extension .c
for the string
.param window
.period
While searching for the item, &edname displays a window that shows
all files being searched.
.np
When all matches are found, a selection window is presented with
all the files that contained the search string.
.np
The selection window appears as follows:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi023' FGrep result display
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Mapping Keys'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
A powerful feature in &edname is the ability to change the meaning of any key in
.keyword &cmdmode
or
.keyword &tinsmode
.period
Using this feature, you can configure the editor any way which suits your needs.
.np
The
.keyword &cmdline
commands
.keyref map
and
.keyref mapbase
are used to remap the definition of a key.
The syntax of these commands is as follows:
.millust begin
map "!" &lt.key&gt. &lt.string&gt.
mapbase &lt.key&gt. &lt.string&gt.
.millust end
.np
Both commands remap the specified key
.paramt key
to execute the characters in
.paramt string
.period
Whenever the specified key is pressed while in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , it is equivalent
to typing the characters in
.paramt string
.period
.np
In the
.keyref map
command, specifying the exclamation point ('!') causes the map to be for
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , rather than
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.np
It is possible for
.paramt string
to contain keys that are mapped themselves.
If you want to do a key mapping that is in terms of the base definitions
of the keys, then you should use the
.keyref mapbase
command.
.np
To remove the mapping of a key, the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref unmap
is used.
The syntax of this command is:
.millust begin
unmap &lt.key&gt.
.millust end
.np
If you need to specify a special key (e.g. ENTER, F1, etc) for
.paramt key
you specify a symbolic name for it.
There are a number of pre-defined key symbols that are recognized when
specifying which key is being mapped or unmapped.
These are described in the Appendix
:HDREF refid='symkey'.
.period
.np
If you need to use one or more special keys (e.g. ENTER, F1, etc) in
.paramt string
then you may enter:
.np
:INCLUDE file='spmapkey'.

Enter the following
.keyword &cmdline
command:
.millust begin
:map F5 dd
.millust end
Now, whenever you press
.param F5
.ct , a line will be deleted.
Try pressing
.param F5
a few times to verify this.

:LI.Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.millust begin
:unmap F5
.millust end
and try pressing F5 again.
It will no longer delete lines.

:LI.Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.millust begin
:map F6 :date\n
.millust end
Press
.param F6
.period
The time and date will be displayed in the message window.
You will notice that the command window flashes as you push
.param F6
.period

:LI.Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.millust begin
:map F6 \x:date\n
.millust end
Press
.param F6
.period
The time and date will be displayed in the message window.
You will notice that the command window no longer flashes.

:LI.Bring up the command window ( press ':') and press cursor up.
You will notice that the date commands are in your history.
Now, enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command:
.millust begin
:map F6 \x:\hdate\n
.millust end
Press
.param F6
a few times.
Bring up the command window again and cursor up.
You will see that the date commands did not get added to the history.

:LI.Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command:
.millust begin
:map! F6 \edwi
.millust end
Whenever you press
.param F6
in
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , you will exit insert mode (the \e is like pressing the
.param ESC
key), delete the current word, and then re-enter insert mode.
Try entering
.keyword &tinsmode
and pressing
.param F6
.period

:LI.Exit
.keyword &tinsmode
and press
.param F6
.period
You will notice that the date is still displayed, since the
.keyword &tinsmode
and
.keyword &cmdmode
mappings for
.param F6
are different.
