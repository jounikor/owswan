From this listing, you may pick a file, another directory, or another
drive (the available drives are at the end of the listing).
A directory is indicated
by the leading backslash ('\'). If a directory is chosen in this window,
then the list of files in that directory is displayed.  This
list also contains all the drives available (which are enclosed in
square brackets, e.g. [c:]). If you select a drive, the list of files in the
current directory on that drive is displayed.
.np
For files and directories, each line indicates the file name,
the various attributes of the file ([d]irectory, [a]rchive, [h]idden,
[s]ystem, [r]eadable, [w]riteable, e[x]ecutable), the file size in
bytes, the date and time of the last file update. Some sample lines are:
.millust begin
  test.c        -a--rw-    25586  08/16/92  08:14
  bar.c         -a--r--      639  02/27/92  13:25
 \tmpdir        d---rw-        0  08/16/92  19:05
  [c:]
.millust end
