When mapping keys using the
.keyref map
command, and unmapping keys using the
.keyref unmap
command, it is useful to be able to specify the key that you are
mapping symbolically, especially if it is a function key, a cursor key
or other special key.
There are a number of pre-defined keys symbols that are recognized when
specifying which key is being mapped/unmapped.
.np
The next section describes the symbol used to represent the key, and
what the key actually is.
These symbols are also used throughout this guide to represent a special key.
