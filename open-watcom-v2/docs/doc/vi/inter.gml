.chap *refid=inter 'Intermediate Usage'
.*
.np
This chapter discusses a number of the commonly used features of the &edname..
The knowledge of the information in the chapter
:HDREF page=no refid='basic'.
is assumed.
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'The Command Line'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
The &edname has a powerful set of commands that are entered in a special
command window.
These commands are referred to as
.keyword &cmdline
commands.
You can activate the command window in two ways:
.*
:OL.

:LI.Select the
.keyword Enter command
item under the
.keyword File
menu.

:LI.Press the colon (':') key when in
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
Remember to press the
.param ESC
key to ensure that you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
before pressing ':'.

:eOL.
.*
Once you have done one of the previous things, the following window will
appear on your screen:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi015' The Command Entry window
You may enter a command in this window (for example: quit).
If you wish to cancel the command that you are typing, just press the
.param ESC
key and the window will disappear.
.np
You may cursor back and forth in the command window, and use the
backspace and delete keys to change mistakes.
Once you press
.param ENTER
.ct , the command will be processed.
.np
If you cursor up, you will go through a list of commands
that you have entered at the command window (newest to oldest).
This is your command
.keyword history
.period
Cursoring down will take you through the history from oldest to newest.
This is very useful if you have typed a complicated command and did not get
it quite right or if you just wish to execute the command again.
.np
The chapter
:HDREF refid='cmds'.
describes the
.keyword &cmdline
commands in more detail.
.*
.beglevel
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Line Numbers'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
Some
.keyword &cmdline
commands accept a line address or a line range as a parameter.
For example, when specifying the
.keyref write
command, you may specify
.millust begin
:write
.millust end
or you may specify
.millust begin
:1,10 write
.millust end
.np
A line address is a number or a sum of numbers.
As well, some special symbols may be used:
.*
:DL break.

:DT.. (dot)
:DD.Represents the current line number.

:DT.$ (dollar)
:DD.Represents the last line number.

:DT.'a (front quote)
:DD.Indicates the line with the mark 'a' set; marks 'a' through 'z' may be used.
Marks are discussed later in this chapter.

:eDL.
.*
.np
A line range is two line addresses separated by a comma.
.np
Some examples of line addresses and line ranges are:
.millust begin
 .+5     - five lines past the current line.

 'a      - the line with mark a.

 $       - the last line

 1,5     - lines 1 to 5

 .,$     - current line in file to end line of file

 .-3,100 - the line 3 before the current to line 100
.millust end
Line addresses are discussed in greater detail in the section
:HDREF refid='lineadd'.
.period
.np
If you just enter a line address on its own on the
.keyword &cmdline
.ct , then you will go directly to that line.
.*
.exercises
:OL.

:LI.Start up &edvi, and try selecting the
.keyword File
menu, and then selecting the
.keyword Enter command
item.
Notice how the window pops up.
Try typing and cursoring around.
When you are done, press the
.param ESC
key to cancel the command.

:LI.Make sure that you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , then press the colon (':') key.
Once again, the command window pops up.
Try typing and cursoring around.
When you are done, press the
.param ESC
key to cancel the command.

:LI.Add 10 lines to your file.
Then press the colon (':') key and enter the number 5.
You will go to line 5.
Try entering different numbers and see what happens.
If you enter a line number that does not exist, you will see the message:
.millust begin
No such line
.millust end

:LI.Now that you have a number of commands entered, try cursoring up and down
in the command window.
You will see all the commands that you have typed.

:eOL.

.section 'Getting a File for Editing'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
In the chapter
:HDREF refid='basic' page=no.
.ct , you saw that you could edit a file by either specifying the name
on the command line when invoking &edvi, or by selecting the
.keyword File
menu and picking the
.keyword Edit new file
option.
.np
The general way to edit a new file is to use the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref edit
.period
To enter this command, make sure that you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
and press the colon (':') key.
Once the command prompt is displayed, then simply type
.keyref edit
(optionally followed by a file name or a list of files), and then press
.param ENTER
.period
.np
If you do not specify a file, then a directory listing is displayed.
:INCLUDE file='fsdesc'.
.np
You may also specify one or more files after the
.keyref edit
command.
If a file you specify is the same as one already being edited,
then control is simply transferred to the window with that file.
.*
.exercises
:OL.

:LI.Start up &edvi without any files specified.
Then try entering the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref edit
without any parameters (remember to press the colon (':') key first).
You will see a screen similar to the following:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi016' File Selection display
Try changing to other directories or drives with this list.
When you are done, press the
.param ESC
key to cancel the selection list.

:LI.Try entering the following
.keyword &cmdline
command
.millust begin
:e afile
.millust end
This will cause &edvi to start editing a new file called "afile".

:LI.Try entering the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.millust begin
:e bfile cfile
.millust end
This will cause &edvi to edit two new files, one named "bfile"
and one named "cfile".

:LI.Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.millust begin
:e afile
.millust end
This returns you to the first file ("afile") that you were already editing.

:LI.Press
.param CTRL_C
.ct , and &edvi will quit all the files that you have started editing.

:eOL.
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Moving Between Files'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
There are a number of ways to move between files that you are editing.
As you have seen in the previous section,  you can move to a file
that you are already editing by using the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref edit
and specifying the name of the file you wish to move to.
.np
You may press the
.param F1
key while in
.keyword &cmdmode
or
.keyword &tinsmode
.period
This function key moves you to the next file in the list of files that
you are editing.
.np
You may press the
.param F2
key while in
.keyword &cmdmode
or
.keyword &tinsmode
.period
This function key moves you to the previous file in the list of files that
you are editing.
.np
The previous two function keys that you may use also have
.keyword &cmdline
command equivalents.
The
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref next
moves you to the next file in the list of files that you are editing.
.np
The
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref prev
moves you to the previous file in the list of files that you are editing.
.np
It is also possible to display a list of all files that you are currently
editing.
You may press the
.param F7
key in either
.keyword &cmdmode
or
.keyword &tinsmode
.ct , or enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref files
.period
Doing any one of these things will cause a list of all files currently being
edited to appear.
An asterisk ('*') will precede files that have been modified.
From this list, you may go to one of the files, quit one of the files,
or save one of the files then quit it.
.*
.exercises
:OL.

:LI.Start up &edvi in the following way:
.millust begin
vi a b c
.millust end
This will cause you to edit three new files.
Now, press the
.param F7
key.
The following will appear:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi017' Current File List
Select the file
.param b
.period
That file will become the current file being edited.

:LI.Type the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.millust begin
:files
.millust end
You will see the same result as you saw in the previous example.
Press the
.param ESC
key to cancel this display.

:LI.Press the
.param F1
key several times.
You will rotate through the three files that you are editing.

:LI.Press the
.param F2
key several times.
You will rotate through the three files that you are editing,
but in the opposite order than when you were pressing the
.param F1
key.

:LI.Use the
.keyword &cmdline
commands
.keyref next
and
.keyref prev
to move through the files.
These commands behave the same as pressing
.param F1
and
.param F2
.period

:eOL.
.* ******************************************************************
.section *refid=maiaf 'Moving Around in a File'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
You have already learned to use the cursor keys to move around through a file.
When you are in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , there are a number of keys that also cause movement through the file.
Many of these keys may be preceded with a repeat count.
You enter the repeat count by typing a number (which will be echoed
in a special window on the screen).
.np
Once you have entered the repeat count, you may cancel it by pressing the
.param ESC
key, or you may follow it with a movement command.
For example, if you type:
.millust begin
3&lt.Down Arrow Key&gt.
.millust end
you will move down three lines instead of one.
.np
The basic
.keyword &cmdmode
movement commands are:
:INCLUDE file='basicmv'.
.np
There are additional commands that move you around the file which do not
require your fingers to move off the home row of your keyboard.
For a touch typist, this is a great advantage.
For a list of all of the movement commands, see the section
:HDREF refid='mvement'.
in the chapter
:HDREF page=no refid='modes'.
.period
The following list of movement commands move you around on the current line:
.*
:DL break.

:DT.$ (dollar sign)
:DD.Move to the end of the current line.

:DT.0 (zero)
:DD.Move to the start of the current line.

:DT.b
:DD.Move backwards to the previous word on the current line.
If preceded with a repeat count, you move back that many words.

:DT.h
:DD.Move right through the text.
If preceded with a repeat count, then you move right that many characters.

:DT.l
:DD.Move left through the text.
If preceded with a repeat count, then you move left that many characters.

:DT.w
:DD.Move forward to the next word on the current line.

:LI.Edit a new file, "atest".
Once you have edited this file, add the line:
.millust begin
This is a test line.
.millust end
Once you have done this, copy this line by pressing 'Y'.
Press 'p' to paste in the copy.
Press 'p' 28 more times, so that you create a file with 30 lines in it
(all just like the first line).

:LI.So that we can more easily see the results, type the following
.keyword &cmdline
command:
.millust begin
:%s/^/\# /
.millust end
This is a substitution command.
It will replace the start of each of your lines with the line number.
We will learn about the substitution command in the next chapter.
When you are done, you should see a screen similar to the following:
.figure *depth='2.47' *scale='59' *file='vi018' "ATEST" File Contents

:LI.Press the 'G' key.
You will move to the last line of the file.

.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Saving and Exiting a File Revisited'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
We have already seen in the section
:HDREF refid='savexit'.
a number of ways to save and exit your files.
These methods included typing 'ZZ' and using the menus.
.np
There are a number of different
.keyword &cmdline
commands that can be used for saving and/or quitting your files.
:OL.

:LI.
.keyref quit
("!") or
.param q
("!")

:LI.
.keyref quitall

:LI.
.keyref write
("!") or
.param w
("!")

:LI.
.keyref wq

:LI.
.keyref xit

:eOL.
The
.keyref quit
command is used to exit a file without saving it.
If the file has been modified, the command will fail and the message:
.millust begin
File modified - use :q! to force
.millust end
will be displayed.
To quit a modified file, the exclamation point ('!') is used:
.millust begin
:quit!
.millust end
or
.millust begin
:q!
.millust end
This discards the contents of the current edit buffer.
.np
To quit every file that you are editing, the
.keyref quitall
command is used.
If no files have been modified, then you will immediately exit &edvi..
If files have been modified, you will be asked to verify whether
or not you really want to exit the editor.
.np
The
.keyref write
command is used to write the current file.
If you specify a file name, the edit buffer will be written to a file
with that name.
.millust begin
:write new.txt
.millust end
writes out a new file with the name
:fname.new.txt:efname.
.period
.np
If the file name you specify already exists, you will see the message:
.millust begin
File exists - use w! to force
.millust end
To overwrite an existing file, use the exclamation point ('!'):
.millust begin
write! new.txt
.millust end
or
.millust begin
w! new.txt
.millust end
.np
If you are specifying a new file name, you may also specify a line range
to write to that new file.
Some examples are:
.millust begin
:1,100 write new.txt       - write the first 100 lines to "new.txt".
:50 write a.txt            - write line 50 to "a.txt"
.millust end
.np
The
.keyref wq
(write and quit) and the
.keyref xit
(exit) commands both do the same thing.
They write out the current file if it has been modified, and then exit the file.
This is the exact same as typing 'ZZ' in
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
.*
.exercises
:OL.

:LI.Edit a file as follows:
.millust begin
vi abc
.millust end
Add the lines:
.millust begin
Line 1.
Line 2.
Line 3.
.millust end

:LI.Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref quit
(remember to press the colon (':') key to bring up the command window).
You will see the message:
.millust begin
File modified - use :q! to force
.millust end
Press
.param CTRL_G
.period
The message window will indicate the following:
.millust begin
"abc" [modified] line 3 of 3  -- 100% --
.millust end
As you can see, the file has been modified, so you are not allowed to quit.
.np

:LI.Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref write
.period
You will see the message:
.millust begin
"abc" 3 lines, 27 bytes
.millust end
This indicates that the file has been written.
Now press
.param CTRL_G
.ct , and you will see:
.millust begin
"abc" line 3 of 3  -- 100% --
.millust end
Notice that the file no longer is marked as modified once it is written.

:LI.Try the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref quit
again.
This time, you will be able to quit the file, since the file has been written,
and is no longer marked as modified.

:LI.Re-edit the file "abc".
Enter command:
.millust begin
:1,2 w def
.millust end
This will write out a new file called "def".
Now quit &edvi..

:LI.Edit the file "def".
Notice that it contains the lines
.millust begin
Line 1.
Line 2.
.millust end
These are the first two lines of "abc", that you wrote to this file.
Try entering the command:
.millust begin
:write abc
.millust end
You will see the message
.millust begin
File exists - use w! to force
.millust end
Since "abc" already exists, you are not allowed to overwrite it, unless
you specify the exclamation point, as follows:
.millust begin
:write! abc
.millust end

:LI.Re-edit the file "abc".
Delete the last line.
Press
.param CTRL_G
.ct , and you will see that the file is modified.
Now, enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command (remembering to press ':'):
.millust begin
:q!
.millust end
You will exit the file, even though it has been modified.

:LI.Re-edit the file "abc", and delete the last line.
Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref xit
.period
This will save the file and exit it, and because you are not editing
any other files, you will exit &edvi..
You could also use the command
.keyref wq
to do the same thing.
Both of these commands do the same thing as pressing 'ZZ' while in
.keyword &cmdmode
.period

:LI.Start up &edvi as follows:
.millust begin
vi abc def
.millust end
This will edit two files, "abc" and "def".
Enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref quitall
and you will exit &edvi..

:LI.Repeat the previous example, but add a line to one of the two files.
Now enter the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref quitall
.period
In this case, you will be prompted with
.millust begin
Files are modified, really exit?
.millust end
Reply with a 'y', and you will exit &edvi, even though files are modified.

:eOL.

.section 'Using the Mouse'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
You may use the mouse for many things.
You may select text, relocate the cursor, resize a window, move a window,
use the scroll bar, or use the menus.
.np
Text selection will be discussed in the next section.
Using menus with the mouse was discussed in the previous chapter,
in the section
:HDREF refid='basmenu'.
.period
.np
By simply moving your mouse cursor to a location in an edit window
and clicking the left mouse button, the cursor will move to that
position.
.np
By moving your mouse to the top border of an edit window and pressing
down the left mouse button, you can move the window around
by moving your mouse.
When you release the button, the window will move to the new position.
.np
By moving your mouse to the bottom right hand corner of an edit window
(to the vertical two-headed arrow) and pressing down the left mouse button,
you can resize the window by moving your mouse.
When you release the left button, the window will be redrawn in its new size.
.np
Edit windows have scroll bars which indicate the position in the file and
allow you to position to different portions of the file.
The scroll thumb (the solid block on the scroll bar) indicates the relative
location of your current cursor position in the file.
If the scroll thumb is at the top, then you are on the top line of the file.
If it is at the bottom, then you at the end of the file.
.np
By left-clicking on the single arrows at the top or the bottom of the scroll
bar, the edit window will scroll up or down a single line.
If you hold the left mouse button down, then the window will scroll
continuously.
.np
If you click the left mouse button in the scrollbar region between the
thumb and the top arrow, you will move up a page in the file you are editing.
If you click the left mouse button below the scroll thumb, you will move down
a page in the file you are editing.
If you hold the left mouse button down, then you will page continuously.
.np
By pressing and holding down the left mouse button on the scroll thumb,
you can set the edit position yourself.
As you drag the scroll thumb up and down, the edit window will be redrawn
to show you the corresponding portion of your file.
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Selecting Text'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
&edvi has the ability to highlight (select) text, either on an individual
line or a group of lines, and then do various actions on the highlighted
(selected) text.
.np
You may select text with either the keyboard or the mouse.
The keyboard interface is as follows:
:INCLUDE file='textsel.gml'
.np
Once text selection has been started, then any movement command may
be used to expand or shrink the selected region.
Multiple line selections always select complete lines.
A portion of a single line can be selected (i.e. a word) by growing
the selection left or right.
A portion of a line is called a column region and a multiple line selection
is called a line region.
.np
You can select text with the mouse by holding down the right or left mouse
button, and moving the mouse up and down or left and right.
When using the right button, a selection menu will appear after the mouse
button is released, from which you choose what you wish to do with
the selected text.
.np
If you highlight a region by holding down the left button and moving the mouse,
then releasing the button has no effect (the region simply remains highlighted).
This region may then be operated on from the
.keyword &cmdline
.ct , using different
.keyword &cmdmode
commands, or by right-clicking the mouse in the selected region.
.np
If you click the right mouse button (right-click) while the mouse cursor
is in a highlighted (selected) set of lines, then a selection menu

.section 'Joining Text'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
&edvi has the ability to join two lines together.
If you press the letter 'J' (capital 'j') while in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , then the next line will join to the end of the current line.
All white space except for a single space will be removed.
For example, typing 'J' while on the first line in these two lines:
.millust begin
This is a line.
      This is another line.
.millust end
produces the line:
.millust begin
This is a line.
This is another line.
.millust end
If you precede 'J' with a repeat count, then that many lines after
the current line will be joined to the current line.
For example, typing
.millust begin
4J
.millust end
while on the first line of:
.millust begin
Line 1.
    Line 2.
    Line 3.
Line 4.
    Line 5.
    Line 6.
.millust end
will produce the result:
.millust begin
Line 1. Line 2. Line 3. Line 4. Line 5.
    Line 6.
.millust end
.np
There is also a
.keyword &cmdline
command called
.keyref join
that is used to join lines of text together.
This command is used as follows:
.millust begin
&lt.line_range&gt. join
.millust end
The lines in the specified range
.paramt line_range
are joined together.
If a single line number is specified, then the line after that
line is joined to the specified line.
If no line number is specified, then the line after the current line
is joined to the current line.
For example, the command:
.millust begin
:1,5 join
.millust end
will cause the lines 1 through 5 of the file to be joined into a single line.
.* ******************************************************************
.section 'Using Marks'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
:INCLUDE file='markinfo'.
.np
A mark is useful in that you do not have to remember a specific line number,
you just need to remember the letter that you picked for the mark name.
You can then return to the line or even the exact position on the line easily.
.np
You may set a mark by pressing the letter 'm' (in
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct ) and pressing one of the letters from 'a' to 'z'.
For example, if you type
.millust begin
ma
.millust end
you will set the mark 'a' at the current position in the file,
and you will see the following message appear:
.millust begin
Mark 'a' set
.millust end
.np
You can set a mark with the
.keyword &cmdline
command
.keyref mark
.period
The syntax of the command is
.millust begin
&lt.line&gt. mark &lt.letter&gt.
.millust end
You specify which line the mark is to be set on with
.paramt line
.period
If no line is specified, the current line is assumed.
You specify the mark id ('a'-'z') with
.paramt letter
.period
.np
For example, the following
.keyword &cmdline
commands may be used to set marks:
.millust begin
mark a   - sets the mark 'a' on the current line.
5 mark b - sets the mark 'b' on line 5.
.millust end
.np
Once you have set a mark, you may return to the mark by pressing either
the front quote (apostrophy) (') or the back quote (`), followed by the
letter of the mark you wish to return to.
Using the back quote causes you to return to the row and column position
of the mark.
Using the front quote (apostrophy) causes you to return to the line with
the mark (the cursor moves to the first column on the line).
.np
For example, after setting the mark 'a', you can return to it by typing:
.millust begin
'a   - return to the line with the mark 'a'.
`a   - return to the exact position with the mark 'a'.
.millust end
.np
Marks are useful when you need to go searching a file for something,
but you want to be able to return to a specific position.
They are also useful when deleting and copying text (see the section
:HDREF refid='dcapt'.
later on in this chapter).

.section *refid=dcapt 'Deleting, Copying, and Pasting Text'
.* ******************************************************************
.np
There are two useful commands in &edvi for deleting and copying text.
In
.keyword &cmdmode
.ct , you press the 'd' key to start the delete sub-mode.
You press the 'y' key to start the yank (copy) sub-mode.
Each of these sub-modes is indicated on the mode indicator on the menu bar:
.millust begin
Mode: delete
.millust end
or
.millust begin
Mode: yank
.millust end
.np
Once you have entered the sub-mode, you can then specify one of the following
operations:
:INCLUDE file='operlist'.
.np
Some examples are:
.millust begin
dw     - delete a word
yr     - yank (copy) highlighted region
d/text - delete up to the word "text"
.millust end
.np
These commands can be preceded by an optional repeat count.
This repeat count specifies the number of times that the command will be executed.
If the repeat count is not specified, the command is executed once.
For example:
.millust begin
3dw - delete 3 words
2yy - copy 2 lines
.millust end
.np
A
.keyword &copybuffer
can be specified between the repeat count and the command.
The buffer is identified by preceding it with double quotes (").
For example:
.millust begin
3"ayy - copy 3 lines into buffer 'a'
"zdd  - delete 3 lines into buffer 'z'
.millust end
The optional
.keyword &copybuffer
is a place where deleted or yanked text resides.
If you do not specify a buffer, then the active
.keyword &copybuffer
is assumed.
There are 9 numbered buffers (1-9) that may be selected as the active
.keyword &copybuffer
(buffer 1 is the default active
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct ).
When text enters the active
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct , the old contents of the active
.keyword &copybuffer
spills into the next
.keyword &copybuffer
.period
The contents of each
.keyword &copybuffer
spills into the next, with the end
.keyword &copybuffer
(9) losing its contents.
.np
The active
.keyword &copybuffer
may be selected by pressing
.param CTRL_F1
through
.param CTRL_F9
in
.keyword &cmdmode
.period
When you do this, a message appears showing you which buffer has been selected,
how many lines/characters are in the buffer, and the first line of the buffer.
.np
There are also 26 named buffers, 'a' through 'z'.
The contents of these buffers is constant over the life of your editing session.
They retain their contents until you update them.
.np
For more information on
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct , see the section
:HDREF refid='cpybuff'.
in the chapter
:HDREF page=no refid='modes'.
.period
.np
There is also a
.keyref delete
.keyword &cmdline
command and a
.keyref yank
.keyword &cmdline
command for deleting and yanking text.
These commands only operate on line ranges.
Their syntax is:
.millust begin
&lt.range&gt. delete &lt."?&gt.
&lt.range&gt. yank &lt."?&gt.
.millust end
The
.paramt "?
indicates a
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct , and
.paramt range
indicates a line range.
If no line range is specified, then the current line is assumed.
Some examples are:
.millust begin
:1,5 delete        - delete lines 1 to 5
:1,$ yank "a       - copy all lines into buffer 'a'
:d                 - deletes the current line
.millust end
.np
In the section
:HDREF refid='scap'.
in the previous chapter, you learned about the small 'p' and the
capital 'p' ('P')
.keyword &cmdmode
commands to put (paste) copied or deleted text into the edit buffer.
Remember, small 'p' is used to paste after the current cursor position,
and capital 'p' ('P') is use to paste before the current cursor position.
.np
If what you deleted or yanked was a sequence of characters on a single line,
then these characters are inserted into the current line when you paste.
If you deleted or yanked whole lines, then those lines are inserted
around the current line when you paste.
.np
The put (paste)
.keyword &cmdline
commands accept a
.keyword &copybuffer
as the buffer to paste out of.
The default is the active
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct , but any buffer can be specified.
Once again,
.paramt "?
indicates a
.keyword &copybuffer
.ct :
.millust begin
&lt."?&gt.p
&lt."?&gt.P
.millust end
.np
As well, there is a
.keyword &cmdline
command for pasting text: the
.keyref put
command.
The syntax is:
.millust begin
&lt.line&gt. put &lt.!&gt. &lt."?&gt.
.millust end
If the line
.paramt line
is specified, then the buffer is pasted around the specified line instead
of the current line.
.np
If the exclamation mark is specified, then contents of the
.keyword &copybuffer
are pasted before the specified line.
Otherwise, the contents of the
.keyword &copybuffer
are pasted after the specified line.
.np
The
.paramt "?
is an optional
.keyword &copybuffer
.period
If it is not specified, then the active
.keyword &copybuffer
is used.
The double quotes (") must be specified.
