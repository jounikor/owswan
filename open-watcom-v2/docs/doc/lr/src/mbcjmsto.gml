The
.id &funcb.
converts a shift-JIS character set code to a JIS character
set code.
If the argument is out of range,
.id &funcb.
returns 0.
Valid shift-JIS double-byte characters are those in which the first
byte falls in the range 0x81 through 0x9F or 0xE0 through 0xFC and
whose second byte falls in the range 0x40 through 0x7E or 0x80 through
0xFC.
This is summarized in the following diagram.
.millust begin
   [ 1st byte ]    [ 2nd byte ]
    0x81-0x9F       0x40-0xFC
        or          except 0x7F
    0xE0-0xFC
.millust end

.us Note:
The JIS character set code is a double-byte character set defined by
JIS, the Japan Industrial Standard Institutes.
Shift-JIS is another double-byte character set.
It is defined by Microsoft for personal computers and is based on the
JIS code.
The first byte and the second byte of JIS codes can have values less
than 0x80.
Microsoft has designed shift-JIS code so that it can be mixed in
strings with single-byte alphanumeric codes.
Thus the double-byte shift-JIS codes are greater than or equal to
0x8140.

The
.id &funcb.
function returns zero if the argument is not in the range;
otherwise, the corresponding shift-JIS code is returned.
