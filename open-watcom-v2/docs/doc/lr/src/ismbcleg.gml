The
.id &funcb.
function tests for a valid multibyte character.
Multibyte characters include both single-byte and double-byte
characters.
For example, in code page 932, a legal double-byte character is one in
which the first byte is within the ranges 0x81 - 0x9F or 0xE0 - 0xFC,
while the second byte is within the ranges 0x40 - 0x7E or 0x80 - 0xFC.
This is summarized in the following diagram.
.millust begin
   [ 1st byte ]    [ 2nd byte ]
    0x81-0x9F       0x40-0xFC
        or          except 0x7F
    0xE0-0xFC
.millust end
.desc end
.return begin
The
.id &funcb.
function returns a non-zero value when the argument is a
member of this set of characters; otherwise, zero is returned.
