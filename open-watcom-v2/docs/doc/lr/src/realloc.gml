When the value of the

argument is
.mono NULL,
a new block of memory of
.arg size
bytes is allocated.
.np
If the value of
.arg size
is zero, the
.reffunc free
function is called to release the memory pointed to by
.arg old_blk
.period
.np
Otherwise, the
.id &funcb.
function re-allocates space for an object of
.arg size
bytes by either:
.begbull
.bull
shrinking the allocated size of the allocated memory block
.arg old_blk
when
.arg size
is sufficiently smaller than the size of
.arg old_blk
.period
.bull
extending the allocated size of the allocated memory block
.arg old_blk
if there is a large enough block of unallocated memory immediately
following
.arg old_blk
.period
.bull
allocating a new block and copying the contents of
.arg old_blk
to the new block.
.endbull
.np
Because it is possible that a new block will be allocated, no other
pointers should point into the memory of
.arg old_blk
.period
These pointers will point to freed memory, with possible disastrous
results, when a new block is allocated.
.np
The function returns
.mono NULL
when the memory pointed to by
.arg old_blk
cannot be re-allocated.
In this case, the memory pointed to by
.arg old_blk
is not freed so care should be exercised to maintain a pointer to the
old memory block.

.pc
In the above example,
.mono buffer
will be set to
.mono NULL
if the function fails and will no longer point to the old memory
block.
If
.mono buffer
was your only pointer to the memory block then you will have
lost access to this memory.
.desc end

The
.id &funcb.
function returns a pointer to the start of the re-allocated
memory.
The return value is
.mono NULL
if there is insufficient memory available or if the value of the

Each function reallocates memory from a particular heap, as listed below:
.begterm 8
.termhd1 Function
.termhd2 Heap
.term realloc
Depends on data model of the program

Based heap specified by

value

Near heap (inside the default data segment)

In a small data memory model, the

.reffunc _nrealloc
function; in a large data memory model, the

function is
equivalent to the
.reffunc _frealloc
