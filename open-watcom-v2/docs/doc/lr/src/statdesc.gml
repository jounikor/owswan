The value
.arg m
supplied to the macros is the value of the
.kw st_mode
field of a
.reffunc stat
structure.
The macro evaluates to a non-zero value if the test is true and zero
if the test is false.

Set user ID on execution.
The process's effective user ID shall be set to that of the owner of
the file when the file is run as a program. On a regular file, this
bit should be cleared on any write.

.do end
Set group ID on execution.
Set effective group ID on the process to the file's group when the
file is run as a program. On a regular file, this bit should be
cleared on any write.
