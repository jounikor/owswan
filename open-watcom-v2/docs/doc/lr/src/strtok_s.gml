If there is a runtime-constraint violation, the

pointers, and does not store a value in the object pointed to by

A sequence of calls to the
.id &funcb.
function breaks the string pointed to by
.arg s1
into a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a character
from the string pointed to by
.arg s2
.period
The fourth argument points to a caller-provided char pointer into which the
.id &funcb.
function stores information necessary for it to continue scanning the same
string.
The first call in a sequence has a non-null first argument and
.arg s1max
points to an object whose value is the number of elements in the
character array pointed to by the first argument.
The first call stores an initial value in the object pointed to by
.arg ptr
and updates the value pointed to by
.arg s1max
to reflect the number of elements that remain in
relation to
.arg ptr
.period
Subsequent calls in the sequence have a null first argument and the
objects pointed to by
.arg s1max
and
.arg ptr
are required to have the values stored by the
previous call in the sequence, which are then updated. The separator string pointed to by
.arg s2
may be different from call to call.
The first call in the sequence searches the string pointed to by
.arg s1
for the first character that is not contained in the current separator
string pointed to by
.arg s2
.period
If no such character is found, then there are no tokens in the string pointed to by
.arg s1
and the
.id &funcb.
function returns a null pointer. If such a character is found,
it is the start of the first token. The
.id &funcb.
function then searches from there for the
first character in
.arg s1
that is contained in the current separator string. If no such character is found, the
current token extends to the end of the string pointed to by
.arg s1
.ct , and subsequent searches in the same string for a token return a null pointer.
If such a character is found, it is overwritten by a null character,
which terminates the current token.
In all cases, the
.id &funcb.
function stores sufficient information in the pointer pointed
to by
.arg ptr
so that subsequent calls, with a null pointer for
.arg s1
and the unmodified pointer
value for
.arg ptr
.ct , shall start searching just past the element overwritten by a null character (if any).
