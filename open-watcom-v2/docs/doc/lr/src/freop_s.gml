The

function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by
.arg filename
and associates the stream pointed to by
.arg stream
with it. The
.arg mode
argument has the same meaning as in the fopen_s function (including the mode's effect
on exclusive access and file permissions).
If
.arg filename
is a null pointer,the
.id &funcb.
function attempts to change the mode of
the
.arg stream
to that specified by
.arg mode
.ct , as if the name of the file currently associated with
the stream had been used. It is implementation-defined which changes of mode are
permitted (if any), and under what circumstances.
The
.id &funcb.
function first attempts to close any file that is associated with
.arg stream
.period
Failure to close the file is ignored. The error and end-of-file indicators for the stream are
cleared.
If the file was opened successfully, then the pointer to FILE pointed to by
.arg newstreamptr
will be set to the value of stream. Otherwise, the pointer to FILE
pointed to by
.arg newstreamptr
will be set to a null pointer.
