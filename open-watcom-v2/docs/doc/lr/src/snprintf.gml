.desc begin
The
.id &funcb.
function is equivalent to the
.reffunc fprintf
function, except that the argument
.arg buf
specifies a character array into which the generated output is placed,
rather than to a file.
A null character is placed at the end of the generated character
string.
The maximum number of characters to store, including a terminating
null character, is specified by
.arg count
.period
The
.arg format
string is described under the description of the
.reffunc printf
function.
.widefunc &wfunc. &funcb. <form>
.if &'length(&wfunc.) ne 0 .do begin
The argument
.arg buf
specifies an array of wide characters into which the generated output
is to be written, rather than converted to multibyte characters and
written to a stream.
The maximum number of wide characters to store, including a
terminating null wide character, is specified by
.arg count
.period

.return begin
The
.id &funcb.
function returns the number of characters that would have been
written had
.arg count
been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null
character, or a negative value if an encoding error occurred.
Thus, the null-terminated output has been completely written if and only
if the returned value is nonnegative and less than
.arg count
