The
.id &funcb.
function gets a string of characters from the file
designated by
.kw stdin
and stores them in the array pointed to by
.arg s
until end-of-file is encountered or a new-line character is read.
Size of the array
.arg s
is specified by the argument
.arg n
.ct , this information is used to protect buffer from overflow. If buffer
.arg s
is about to be overflown, runtime-constraint is activated. Any new-line character
is discarded, and a null character is placed immediately after the last character
read into the array.
.desc end

The

.mono NULL
is returned if there was a runtime-constraint violation, or if end-of-file
is encountered and no caracters have been read into the array, or if a
read error occurs.
