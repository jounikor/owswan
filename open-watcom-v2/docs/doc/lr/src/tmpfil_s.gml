The
.id &funcb.
function creates a temporary binary file that is different from any other
existing file and that will automatically be removed when it is closed or at program
termination. If the program terminates abnormally, whether an open temporary file is
removed is implementation-defined. The file is opened for update with "wb+" mode
with the meaning that mode has in the fopen_s function (including the mode's effect
on exclusive access and file permissions).
If the file was created successfully, then the pointer to FILE pointed to by
.arg streamptr
will be set to the pointer to the object controlling the opened file. Otherwise, the pointer
to FILE pointed to by
.arg streamptr
will be set to a null pointer.

For all systems except NetWare, the temporary file is located in the
path specified by one of the following environment variables, if one
is defined.
Otherwise, the current working directory is used.
