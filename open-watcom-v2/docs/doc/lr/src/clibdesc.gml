.np
Each of the functions or macros in the C Library is described in this
chapter.
Each description consists of a number of subsections:
.in 0
.begnote $setptnt &INDlvl
.*
.note Synopsis:
.*
This subsection gives the header files that should be included within
a source file that references the function or macro.
It also shows an appropriate declaration for the function or for a
function that could be substituted for a macro.
This declaration is not included in your program; only the header
file(s) should be included.
.pp
When a pointer argument is passed to a function and that function does
not modify the item indicated by that pointer, the argument is shown
with
.kw const
before the argument.
For example,
.millust begin
const char *string
.millust end
.pc
indicates that the array pointed at by
.arg string
is not changed.
.*
.note Constraints:
.*
This subsection describes Runtime-constraints for Safer C Library functions.
.*
.note Safer C:
.*
This subsection points to the Safer C version of the described "unsafe" function.
.*
.note Description:
.*
This subsection is a description of the function or macro.
.*
.note Returns:
.*
This subsection describes the return value (if any)
for the function or macro.
.*
.note Errors:
.*
This subsection describes the possible
.kw errno
values.
.*
.note See Also:
.*
This optional subsection provides a list of related functions or
macros.
.*
.note Example:
.*
This optional subsection consists of one or more examples of
the use of the function.
The examples are often just fragments of code (not complete programs)
for illustration purposes.
:cmt. .pp
:cmt. The examples often use the
:cmt. .reffunc printf
:cmt. function.
:cmt. Normally, the header file
:cmt. .hdrfile stdio.h
:cmt. would be included when that function is used.
:cmt. This file is not shown in the examples, unless it is otherwise
:cmt. required.
