If

The
.id &funcb.
function converts a sequence of wide characters from the array
indirectly pointed to by
.arg src
into a sequence of corresponding multibyte characters that
begins in the conversion state described by the object pointed to by
.arg ps
.period
If
.arg dst
is not a null pointer, the converted characters are then stored
into the array pointed to by
.arg dst
.period
Conversion continues up to and including a terminating null wide character,
which is also stored.
.np
Conversion stops earlier in two cases:
:ul.
:li.
when a wide character is reached that does not correspond to a valid multibyte
character;
:li.
(if
.arg dst
is not a null pointer) when the next multibyte character would exceed the
limit of n total bytes to be stored into the array pointed to by
.arg dst
.period
If the wide
character being converted is the null wide character, then n is the lesser of
.arg len
or
.arg dstmax
.period
Otherwise, n is the lesser of
.arg len
or
.arg dstmax-1
.period
:eul.
If the conversion stops without converting a null wide character and
.arg dst
is not a null
pointer, then a null character is stored into the array pointed to by
.arg dst
immediately
following any multibyte characters already stored. Each conversion takes place as if by a
call to the
.reffunc wcrtomb
function.
.np
If
.arg dst
is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by
.arg src
is assigned either a null
pointer (if conversion stopped due to reaching a terminating null wide character) or the
address just past the last wide character converted (if any). If conversion stopped due to
reaching a terminating null wide character, the resulting state described is the initial
conversion state.
.np
Regardless of whether
.arg dst
is or is not a null pointer, if the input conversion encounters a
wide character that does not correspond to
.im _mbsret5
Otherwise, the
.id &funcb.
function stores
into
.arg *retval
the number of bytes in the resulting multibyte character sequence, not
including the terminating null character (if any).
.np
All elements following the terminating null character (if any) written by &funcb.
in the array of
.arg dstmax
elements pointed to by
.arg dst
take unspecified values when

returns.

If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the objects take on unspecified
values.
