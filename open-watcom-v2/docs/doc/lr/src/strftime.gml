The

The

function is identical to
.id &wfunc.
except that the
.arg format
is not a wide character string.
.do end
.np
The
.arg format
string consists of zero or more directives and ordinary characters.
A directive consists of a '%' character followed by a character
that determines the substitution that is to take place.
All ordinary characters are copied unchanged into the array.
No more than
.arg maxsize
characters are placed in the array.
The format directives %D, %h, %n, %r, %t, and %T are from POSIX.

.note %t
tab character (POSIX)
.note %T
24-hour clock time in the format HH:MM:SS (POSIX)
.note %u
is replaced by the ISO 8601 weekday as a decimal number (1-7), where Monday is 1
.note %U
week number of the year as a decimal number (0-52) where Sunday
is the first day of the week
.note %V
is replaced by the ISO 8601 week number as a decimal number (1-53)
.note %w
weekday as a decimal number (0-6) where 0 is Sunday
.note %W

.note %X
locale's appropriate time representation
.note %y
year without century as a decimal number (0-99)
.note %Y
year with century as a decimal number
.note %z
offset from UTC in the ISO 8601 format '-0430' (meaning 4 hours 30 minutes behind
UTC, west of Greenwich), or by no characters, if no timezone is determinable
.note %Z
timezone name, or by no characters if no timezone exists
.note %%
character %
.endnote
.np
When the
.mono %Z
or
.mono %z
directive is specified, the
.reffunc tzset
function is called.
.np
% g, %G, %V give values according to the ISO 8601 week-based year. In this
system, weeks begin on a monday and week 1 of the year is the week that
includes January 4th, which is also the week that includes the first Thursday
of the year, and is also the first week that contains at least four days in
the year. If the first Monday of January is the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the preceding
days are part of the last week of the preceding year; thus, for Saturday
2nd January 1999, %G is replaced by 1998 and %V is replaced by 53.
If december 29th, 30th, or 31st is a Monday, it and any following days are
part of week 1 of the following year. Thus, for Tuesday 30th December 1997,
%G is replaced by 1998 and %V is replaced by 01.
.np
The format modifiers E and O are ignored. (eg. %EY is the same as %Y)
.desc end
.return begin
If the number of characters to be placed into the array is less than
.arg maxsize
.ct , the
.id &funcb.
function returns the number of characters placed into the
array pointed to by
.arg s
not including the terminating null character.
Otherwise, zero is returned.
