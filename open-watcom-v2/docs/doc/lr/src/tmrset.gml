The
.id &funcb.
function arms or resets the timer
.arg timerid
using the interval and value specified in
.arg new_value
pointer.  The previous interval and value is returned in the
.arg oldvalue
pointer.
.np
The structure pointed to by the "it_value" member of
.arg new_value
specifies the time in the future when the timer will expire,
and effectively arms the timer.  If the it_value member of
.arg new_value
specifies a time of zero, the timer is disarmed.  The structure
pointed to by the "it_interval" member of
.arg new_value
specifies the interval after the initial timer expiration when
the timer would repeat expiration.  If the it_interval member's
components are set to zero, the timer will expire at the time
specified by the "it_value" member of
.arg new_value
and the timer will not automatically rearm.
.np
The "it_value" member of
.arg new_value
is regarded, by default, as a time relative to the system clock
at the time of the function call.  If flags incorporates the
TIMER_ABSTIME constant, the time in "it_value" is regarded as
an absolute system time as opposed to a time relative to
calling this function.

If successful, the function will return zero. If the call fails, the
return value is -1, and
.kw errno
will be set appropriately.
