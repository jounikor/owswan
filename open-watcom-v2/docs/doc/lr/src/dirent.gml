.np
The file
.hdrfile &dirhdr
contains definitions for the structure
.if '&machsys' eq 'QNX' .do begin
.kw dirent
and the
.kw DIR
type.
.np
In QNX the
.kw dirent
structure contains a
.reffunc stat
structure in the
.kw d_stat
member.
To speed up applications which often want both the name and the stat
data, a resource manager may return the
.reffunc stat
information at the same time the
.reffunc readdir
function is called.
.np
However, since the support of this feature is left to the discretion
of various resource managers, every program must use the following
test to determine if the
.kw d_stat
member contains valid data:
.millust begin
d_stat.st_status & _FILE_USED
.millust end
.pc
This test must be performed after every
.reffunc readdir
call.
.np
If the
.kw d_stat
member doesn't contain valid data and the data is needed then the
application should construct the file's pathname and call
.reffunc stat
or
.reffunc lstat
as appropriate.

The file attribute field
.kw d_attr
field is a set of bits representing the following attributes.
.blkcode begin
_A_RDONLY       /* Read-only file */
_A_HIDDEN       /* Hidden file */
_A_SYSTEM       /* System file */
_A_VOLID        /* Volume-ID entry (only MSFT knows) */
_A_SUBDIR       /* Subdirectory */
_A_ARCH         /* Archive file */
.blkcode end
.np
If the
.mono _A_RDONLY
bit is off, then the file is read/write.

The format of the
.kw d_time
field is described by the following structure
(this structure is not defined in any &company header file).
.blkcode begin
typedef struct {
    unsigned short  twosecs : 5;    /* seconds / 2    */
    unsigned short  minutes : 6;    /* minutes (0,59) */
    unsigned short  hours   : 5;    /* hours (0,23)   */
} ftime_t;
.blkcode end
.np
The format of the
.kw d_date
field is described by the following structure
(this structure is not defined in any &company header file).
.blkcode begin
typedef struct {
    unsigned short  day     : 5;    /* day (1,31)   */
    unsigned short  month   : 4;    /* month (1,12) */
    unsigned short  year    : 7;    /* 0 is 1980    */
