The
.id &funcb.
function gets a string of characters from the file
designated by
.kw stdin
and stores them in the array pointed to by
.arg buf
until end-of-file is encountered or a new-line character is read.
Any new-line character is discarded, and a null character is placed
immediately after the last character read into the array.
.widefunc &wfunc. &funcb.
.if &'length(&wfunc.) ne 0 .do begin
The
.id &wfunc.
function gets a string
of multibyte characters (if present) from the input stream pointed to
by
.kw stdin
.ct , converts them to wide characters, and stores them in the
wide character array pointed to by
.arg buf
until end-of-file is encountered or a wide character new-line
character is read.
.do end
.np
It is recommended that
.reffunc fgets
be used instead of
.id &funcb.
because data beyond the array
.arg buf
will be destroyed if a new-line character is not read from the input stream
.kw stdin
before the end of the array
.arg buf
is reached.
.np
A common programming error is to assume the presence of a new-line
character in every string that is read into the array.
A new-line character may not appear as the last character in a file,
just before end-of-file.
.desc end
.return begin
The
.id &funcb.
function returns
.arg buf
if successful.
.mono NULL
is returned if end-of-file is encountered, or if a read error occurs.
