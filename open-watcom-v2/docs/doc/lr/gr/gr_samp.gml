This chapter contains two sample programs that make use of the
&company &lang Graphics Library.
These programs demonstrate some of the more advanced capabilities of the
library.
.np
The first program displays the text string "WATCOM &lang Graphics".
The text sweeps in from the top and bottom of the screen, gradually
increasing in size as it approaches the centre of the screen.
.np
The second program draws bar and pie charts.
The two charts are drawn side by side on the screen.
