A pixel value is associated with each point.
The values range from 0 to the number of colors (less one)
that can be represented in the palette for the current video mode.
The color displayed at the point is the color in the palette
corresponding to the pixel number.
For example, a pixel value of 3 causes the fourth color in the
palette to be displayed at the point in question.
