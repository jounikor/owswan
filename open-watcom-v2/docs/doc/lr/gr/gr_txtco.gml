A pixel value is associated with each character.
The value ranges from 0 to the number of colors (less one)
that can be represented in the palette for the video mode
that is current.
The color of a displayed character is the color in the palette
corresponding to the pixel number.
For example, a pixel value of 3 causes the fourth color in the
palette to be used to display the character in question.
