file extension will be :FNAME.&lst:eFNAME..
By default, listing files are written to disk.
The "disk" option will override any previously specified "type" or
"print" option.
.*
.note DT=<size>
.ixm 'DT=<size> option'
.ixm 'options' 'DT=<size>'
The "data threshold" option is used to set the minimum size for data
objects to be included in the default data segment.
Normally, all data objects smaller than 256 bytes in size are placed
in the default data segment.
When there is a large amount of static data, it is often useful to set
the data threshold size so that all objects of the specified size or
larger are placed into another segment.
For example, the option:
.millust begin
/DT=100
.millust end
.pc
causes all data objects of 100 bytes or more to be placed in a far
data segment.
The "data threshold" only applies to the large and huge memory models
where there can be more than one data segment.
The default data threshold value is 256.

.ixm 'ERRORFILE option'
.ixm 'options' 'ERRORFILE'
:cmt. .ixm 'NOERRORFILE option'
:cmt. .ixm 'options' 'NOERRORFILE'
This option is used to control whether error messages are output to
a separate error file.
The error file is a disk file of type :FNAME.&err:eFNAME. and
is produced if any diagnostic messages are issued by the compiler.
Specifying "noerrorfile" prevents the creation of an error file.
By default, an error file is created.
.np
If an error file exists before compilation begins, it will be erased.
If no diagnostic messages are produced then an error file will not be
created even though the "errorfile" option is selected.
This option has no effect on the inclusion of diagnostic messages in
the source listing file or the production of diagnostic messages on
the screen.

The "explicit" option requires the type of all symbols to be
explicitly declared.
An error message will be issued by the compiler if a symbol that does
not appear in a type declaration statement is encountered.
Specifying this option is equivalent to using the
.kw IMPLICIT NONE
statement.
By default, symbols do not have to be explicitly typed.
.*

:cmt. .ixm 'options' 'NOFORMAT'
The "format" option suppresses the run-time checking that ensures that
the type of an input/output list item matches the format edit
descriptor in a format specification.
This allows an input/output list item of type INTEGER to be formatted
using an F, E or D edit descriptor.
It also allows an input/output list item of a floating-point type to
be formatted using an I edit descriptor.
Normally, this generates an error.
The "format" option is particularly useful for applications that use
integer arrays to store integer and floating-point data.
The default option is "noformat".

In certain rare cases, the result of a floating-point divide could
have less precision than it should.
Contact Intel directly for more information on the issue.

If the FDIV instruction is found to be flawed, the low order bit of
the run-time system variable

If the FDIV instruction does not show the problem, the low order bit
will be clear.
If the Pentium FDIV flaw is a concern for your application, there are
two approaches that you could take:

You may test the
.mono __chipbug
variable in your code in all floating-point and memory models and take
appropriate action (such as display a warning message or discontinue
the application).

Alternately, you can use the "fpd" option when compiling your code.
This option directs the compiler to generate additional code whenever
an FDIV instruction is generated which tests the low order bit of
.mono __chipbug
and, if on, calls the software workaround code in the math libraries.
If the bit is off, an in-line FDIV instruction will be performed as
before.

This includes double-byte characters.
This option enables the use of Korean variable names.
The compiler's run-time system will ensure that character strings are

This option is used to control whether a line-feed character
(LF=CHAR(10)) is to be emitted before a form-feed character
(FF=CHAR(12)) is emitted.
This option applies to carriage control handling.
Normally, the run-time system will emit only a form-feed character to
cause a page eject when the ASA control character "1" is found in the
first column of a record.
The "lfwithff" option will cause the run-time system to emit a
line-feed character and then a form-feed character.
.np
The "lfwithff" option will have little effect on printers, but it will
change the appearance of output to the screen by eliminating
overwritten text when form-feed characters are not handled by the
output device.
The default option is "nolfwithff".

.note OB
.ixm 'OB option'
.ixm 'options' 'OB'
(32-bit only)
This option allows the use of the ESP register as a base register to
reference local variables and subprogram arguments in the generated
code.
This can reduce the size of the prologue/epilogue sequences generated
by the compiler thus improving overall performance.
Note that when this option is specified, the compiler will abort when
there is not enough memory to optimize the subprogram.
By default, the code generator uses more memory-efficient algorithms
when a low-on-memory condition is detected.
.*
.note OBP
.ixm 'OBP option'
.ixm 'options' 'OBP'
This option causes the code generator to try to order the blocks of
code emitted such that the "expected" execution path (as determined by
a set of simple heuristics) will be straight through, with other cases
being handled by jumps to separate blocks of code "out of line".
This will result in better cache utilization on the Pentium.
If the heuristics do not apply to your code, it could result in a
performance decrease.

This option is required if you wish to link an overlayed program using
the Microsoft DOS Overlay Linker.
The Microsoft DOS Overlay Linker will create overlay calls for a
"CALL" instruction only.
This option is not required when using the &lnkname..
This option is not assumed by default.

.*
.note ODO
.ixm 'ODO option'
.ixm 'options' 'ODO'
Optimized DO-loop iteration code is generated.
Caution should be exercised with the use of this option since the case
of an iterating value overflowing is assumed to never occur.
The following example should not be compiled with this option since
the terminal value of
.id IX
wraps from a positive integer to a negative integer.
.exam begin

.exam end
.np
The values of
.id IX
are 32766, 32767, -32768, -32767, ... since
.id IX
is INTEGER*2 (a 16-bit signed value) and it never exceeds the terminal
value.
.*
.note OF
.ixm 'OF option'
.ixm 'options' 'OF'
This option selects the generation of traceable stack frames for those
functions that contain calls or require stack frame setup.
To use &company's "Dynamic Overlay Manager" (DOS only), you must
compile all modules using the "of" option.
For near functions, the following function prologue sequence is
generated.
.np
.us 16-bit:
.millust begin
    push BP
    mov  BP,SP
.millust end
.np
.us 32-bit:
.millust begin
    push EBP
    mov  EBP,ESP
.millust end
.pc
For far functions, the following function prologue sequence is
generated.
.np
.us 16-bit:
.millust begin
    inc  BP
    push BP
    mov  BP,SP
.millust end
.np
.us 32-bit:
.millust begin
    inc  EBP
    push EBP
    mov  EBP,ESP
.millust end
.pc
The BP/EBP value on the stack will be even or odd depending on the
code model.
For 16-bit DOS systems, the Dynamic Overlay Manager uses this
information to determine if the return address on the stack is a short
address (16-bit offset) or long address (32-bit segment:offset).
This option is not assumed by default.

Generate inline 80x87 code for math functions like sin, cos, tan, etc.
If this option is selected, it is the programmer's responsibility to
make sure that arguments to these functions are within the range
accepted by the
.id fsin, fcos,
etc. instructions since no run-time check is made.
.np
If the "ot" option is also specified, the
.id exp
function is generated inline as well.
This option is not assumed by default.
.*
.note ON
.ixm 'ON option'
.ixm 'options' 'ON'
This option allows the compiler to perform certain numerical calculations in
a more efficient manner.
Consider the following example.
.millust begin
Z1 = X1 / Y
Z2 = X2 / Y
.millust end
.np
If the "on" option is specified, the code generator will generate code that
is equivalent to the following.
.millust begin
T = 1 / Y
Z1 = X1 * T
Z2 = X2 * T
.millust end
.np
Since floating-point multiplication is more efficient that division,
the code generator decided to first compute the reciprocal of Y and
then multiply X1 and X2 by the reciprocal of Y.
.np
Note that this optimization may produce less slightly different
results since some, for certain values, precision is lost when
computing the reciprocal.
By using this option, you are indicating that you are willing to
accept the loss in precision for the gain in performance.
.*
.note OP
.ixm 'OP option'
.ixm 'options' 'OP'
By default, floating-point variables may be cached in 80x87
floating-point registers across statements when compiling with the
"fpi" or "fpi87" options.
Floating-point register temporaries use 64 bits of precision in the
mantissa whereas single and double-precision variables use fewer bits
of precision in the mantissa.
The use of this option will force the result to be stored in memory
after each FORTRAN statement is executed.
This will produce less accurate but more predictable floating-point
results.
The code produced will also be less efficient when the "op" option
is used.
.exam begin
XMAX = X + Y / Z
YMAX = XMAX + Q
.exam end
.np
When the "op" option is used in conjunction with the "fpi" or "fpi87"
option, the compiler's code generator will update
.id XMAX
before proceeding with the second statement.
In the second statement, the compiler will reload
.id XMAX
from memory rather than using the result of the previous statement.
The effect of the "op" option on the resulting code can be seen by the
increased code size statistic as well as through the use of the
&disname..
This option is not assumed by default.
.*
.note OR
.ixm 'OR option'
.ixm 'options' 'OR'
This option enables reordering of instructions (instruction
scheduling) to achieve better performance on pipelined architectures
such as the 486.
Selecting this option will make it slightly more difficult to debug
because the assembly language instructions generated for a source
statement may be intermixed with instructions generated for
surrounding statements.
This option is not assumed by default.
.*
.note OS

issued for all unreferenced symbols.
In a source file, the option appears as a comment line and takes the
following form.
.millust begin
*$[NO]Reference
.millust end
.pc
This option is most useful when used in an include file that is
included by several subprograms.
Consider an include file that defines many parameter constants and
only a few are referenced by any one subprogram.
If the first line of the include file is
.millust begin
*$noreference
.millust end

:cmt. .ixm 'options' 'NOSG'
(32-bit only)
.ix 'multi-threaded applications'
The "sg" option is useful for 32-bit OS/2 multi-threaded applications.
It requests the code generator to emit a run-time call at the start of
any function that has more than 4K bytes of automatic variables
(variables located on the stack).
Under 32-bit OS/2, the stack is grown automatically in 4K pages
using the stack "guard page" mechanism.
The stack consists of in-use committed pages topped off with a special
guard page.
A memory reference into the 4K guard page causes OS/2 to grow the
stack by one 4K page and to add a new 4K guard page.
This works fine when there is less than 4K of automatic variables in a
function.
When there is more than 4K of automatic data, the stack must be grown
in an orderly fashion, 4K bytes at a time, until the stack has grown
sufficiently to accommodate all the automatic variable storage
requirements.
