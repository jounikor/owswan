.section The README File
.*
.np
Before you install &product, you should read the contents of the
"README" file which is stored in the root directory of the CD-ROM.
It contains valuable, up-to-date information concerning this product.
.*
.section Installing &product
.*
.np
.ix 'installing &product'
.ix 'installation' 'previous version'
The installation program in this version has been completely
redesigned with several new "smart" features.
If you have installed a previous version of &product then you should
install &product &verrev into the same path (except for the reason
described in the following paragraph).
It will examine a previous installation to determine what features
were previously installed.
It will use this information to establish default settings for the
installation that you are about to attempt.
Of course, you can add or remove features as you progress through the
installation steps.
.np
If you are installing only one of the &watc or &watf products and you
have an older version of the other product, we do NOT recommend that
you install the new product into the same directory as the old
product.
The &watc and &watf products are compatible at the same version
number.
However, the &watc and &watf products are usually NOT compatible
across different version numbers.
If this is the case, care must be exercised when switching between
use of the two products.
Environment variables such as
.ev PATH
and
.ev WATCOM
must be modified and/or corrected.
System files such as
.fi CONFIG.SYS
and
.fi SYSTEM.INI
must be modified and/or corrected.
.np
If you are installing both &watc &verrev and &watf &verrev, we
recommend that you install both products under the same directory.
This will eliminate duplication of files and, as a result, reduce
the total required disk space.
The two products share the use of certain environment variables
which point to the installation directory.
If separate installation directories are used, problems will arise.
.np
When you install &watc and &watf in the same directory, you should not
deselect any options when running the second installation;
otherwise the second product's install may remove files that were
installed (and are required) by the first product's install.
This isn't an issue if you only have one of &watc or &watf..
The problem is that &watc and &watf don't know about the installation
options you have selected for each other's product.
.np
If you wish to create a backup of your previous version, please do so
before installing &product &verrev..
.np
If you decide to install &product &verrev into a different
directory than the previously installed version, you will have to
manually edit system files (e.g., CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT,
SYSTEM.INI) after the installation process is complete to remove the
old version from various environment variables (e.g., PATH, DEVICE=).
This is necessary since the path to the new version will appear after
the path to the old version.
To avoid this extra work, we recommend installing the new version into
the same path as the old version.
.np
As an example, here are a few of the environment variables and "RUN"
directives that are modified/added to the OS/2
.fi CONFIG.SYS
file.
You should make sure that all references to the older version of the
software are removed.

.ix 'installation' 'multiple operating systems'
You may wish to run &product under more than one operating system on
the same personal computer.
For every operating system that you use, simply start up the operating
system and run the corresponding install procedure.
.np
If you run the Windows 3.x installation procedure, you do not need
to run the DOS installation procedure also.
.np
If you plan to use Win-OS/2 as a development platform under OS/2, you
must run the Windows 3.1 install program (selecting Windows 3.1 host
support).
.np
Place the CD-ROM disk in your CD-ROM drive.
Select one of the following procedures depending on the host operating
system that you are currently running.
Below, substitute the CD-ROM drive specification for "x:".

.ix 'installation' 'modifications to files'
The install program makes changes to your operating system startup
files to allow &product to run.
We strongly recommend that you allow the install program to modify
your system configuration files for you, but you may do it by hand.
The changes required may be found in any of the following files which
have been placed in the root of the installation directory:
.begnote $setptnt 15
.note CONFIG.NEW

The &ide (&vip.) uses the IBM OS/2 Enhanced System Editor (EPM) for
editing text files. You must ensure that EPM is installed in your OS/2
system if you are planning to use the &vip.. You can selectively install
the Enhanced Editor by running the OS/2 Setup and Installation program
(Selective Install) and choosing "Enhanced Editor" from the "Tools and
Games" detail page.
.note
.ix 'UNDELETE'
On some systems with limited memory that use the UNDELETE feature of
OS/2, compile times may be slow because OS/2 is saving copies of
compiler temporary files.
