This book was produced with the &company GML electronic publishing
system, a software tool developed by WATCOM.
In this system, writers use an ASCII text editor to create source
files containing text annotated with tags.
These tags label the structural elements of the document, such as
chapters, sections, paragraphs, and lists.
The &company GML software, which runs on a variety of operating
systems, interprets the tags to format the text into a form such as
you see here.
Writers can produce output for a variety of printers, including laser
printers, using separately specified layout directives for such things
as font selection, column width and height, number of columns, etc.
The result is type-set quality copy containing integrated text and
graphics.
