:PREFACE.
:PC.This manual describes the text preparation language GML
(Generalized Markup Language).
The language was originally developed by IBM for use with
the DCF (Document Composition Facility) product distributed
by IBM.
The language is used in many installations as a convenient means
of specifying the components of the input text
to be formatted into documents.
:P.
&WGML. may be used for all stages of document preparation.
&WGML. may also be used as a "debugging" document processor
during the draft stages of a document.
The direct processing of GML tags provides a
precise diagnosis of errors and faster processing of the document.
Waterloo Script or IBM DCF can then be used to produce the final
copy of the document.
:CMT. :P.

:CMT. have been involved either directly or indirectly in the implementation
