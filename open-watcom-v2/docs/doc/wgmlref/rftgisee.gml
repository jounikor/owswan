:p.
The :hp2.see:ehp2.
:I2 refid='gasee'.gasee
attribute will cause the supplied character
string to be used as a page number reference.
The character text :q.See:eq. will prefix the character string
in the index if there are no references in the index entry.
If there are index subentries or page references, the string
:q.See also:eq. will be prefixed to the character string.
It is your responsibility to ensure that index entries specified
in the character string are actually in the index.
The :HP2.see:eHP2. attribute may only be used when the index entry
is of level one or two.
