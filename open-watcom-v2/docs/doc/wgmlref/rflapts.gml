:DT.pre_top_skip
:I2 refid='lapre_t'.lapre_t
:DD.This attribute accepts vertical space units.
    A zero value means that no lines are skipped.
    If the skip value is a line unit,
    it is multiplied by the current line spacing
    (see :HDREF refid='specver'. for more information).
    The resulting amount of space is skipped before the
    &local..
    The pre-top-skip will be merged with the previous document entity's
    post-skip value.
    The specified space is still skipped at the beginning of a new page.
