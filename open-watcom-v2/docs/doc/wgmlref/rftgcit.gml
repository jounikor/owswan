This tag starts the highlighting of a citation (e.g., the title of a
book).
The actual highlighting to be performed is determined by the layout and
the type of output device the document is processed for.
Examples of highlighting include underlining, displaying in bold
face, or using a different character shape (such as italics).

A citation may not be used where the GML layout explicitly determines
the emphasis to be used, such as in the text of a heading.

The citation tag is a paragraph element.
It is used with text to create the content of a basic document
element, such as a paragraph.

:HP2.&gml.cit:eHP2. tag.
