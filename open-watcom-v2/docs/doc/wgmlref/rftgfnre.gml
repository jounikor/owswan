The number of the referenced footnote
will be generated at the point where the :hp2.&gml.fnref:ehp2. tag
is specified.
The footnote reference tag is a paragraph element,
and is used with text to create the content of a basic document
element.

the footnote for which the reference will be generated.
The identifier name must be specified as the value
for the id attribute on the footnote you wish to reference.
