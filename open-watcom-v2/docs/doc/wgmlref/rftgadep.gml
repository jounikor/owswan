:p.
The :hp2.depth:ehp2. attribute accepts
:I2 refid='gadepth'.gadepth
vertical space units as possible values.
The amount of specified vertical space is created in the output before
any source input text is processed.
The value of the depth attribute is linked to the current font
(see :HDREF refid='fnlink'.).
