This chapter describes the screens presented by &WGML.
:I1.screen displays
:I1.formatting
:I1.running &WGML.
:I1.WGMLUI program
before and during the processing of a document.
These screen displays are presented when working on a
&ibmpc. or compatible computer system.
You may omit reading this chapter
if you are using &WGML. on an &ibmvm. or &decvax. computer
system.
:P.
The &WGML. document processing system is composed of two programs.
The WGML program produces a formatted document for a specified output device.
The screens displayed by this program are
discussed in the first section.
The WGMLUI (:HP2.W:eHP2.ATCOM GML :HP2.U:eHP2.ser :HP2.I:eHP2.nterface)
program provides a mechanism for working with your source document
and selecting the options for the WGML program.
The screens displayed by WGMLUI are discussed in the second section.
:P.
You may choose to start either WGMLUI or the WGML program.
It is suggested that you use WGMLUI to process your documents
until you have become familiar with the WGML options.
