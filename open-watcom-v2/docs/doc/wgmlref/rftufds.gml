The file browser presents you with an area at the top of the browser
where you may enter a new name.
The available files are shown in a list, with the file extension of 'gml'
being used to selectively display the files in the directory.
If your files have an extension other than 'gml', you may edit
the file pattern to specify a different pattern (such as *.doc) by pressing
the &key.F3&ekey. key.
You may also choose a new file from the list displayed on the screen.
