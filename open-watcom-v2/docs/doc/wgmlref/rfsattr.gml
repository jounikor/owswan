:H2 id='specatt'.Tag Attributes
:P.
A tag attribute is used to modify or define the behaviour
of the tag.
:I1.attribute
For example, the :HP2.depth='5i':eHP2. attribute is used with the figure tag
to specify the depth of the figure.
This attribute will reserve five inches of space
in the document for pasting in a figure.
The value of the attribute (ie '5i') must not be split across input records.
:P.
Attribute values may be enclosed in quotes.
Either single or double quotes may be used.
If the value contains a quote character which is the same as
the enclosing quotes, the quote can be specified twice to
enter it into the value.
Accents are also accepted as a quoting character.
A character string must be enclosed in quotes.

:P.
The attributes of a tag may be specified over a number of input
records, and are separated from the tag and each other by a space.
Although the attributes are separated from the tag, they are
considered part of the tag specification and must precede the
period which ends the tag.
Attribute values which contain a
period should be enclosed in quotes to
prevent the termination of the tag specification.
