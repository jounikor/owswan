:p.
The :hp2.seeid:ehp2.
:I2 refid='gaseeid'.gaseeid
attribute is used to reference an index entry.
The index term created by the referenced index entry is used
instead of a page number.
If the referenced index entry has the :hp2.print:ehp2. attribute
specified, the character string value of the :hp2.print:ehp2.
attribute will be used instead of the index term.
The character string :q.See:eq. will prefix the index term
in the index if there are no page references in the index entry.
If there are index subentries or page references, the string
:q.See also:eq. will be prefixed to the index term.
The :HP2.seeid:eHP2. attribute may only be used when the index entry
is of level one or two.
