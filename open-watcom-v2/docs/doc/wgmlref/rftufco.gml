:H3 id='frconf'.Changing the Configuration
Selecting &menu.Configure&emenu. from the &menu.Control&emenu. menu presents
a dialogue on the screen for changing the defaults used by the
WGMLUI program.
.screen 'frconf' 'Configuration Screen'
:P.
When you have finished making the configuration changes, pressing
the &g_enter. key will finish the dialogue.
The configuration changes will not be saved when you
leave the WGMLUI program.
If you wish to make the changes permanent, leave the dialogue by
pressing the &key.F2&ekey. key instead.
:P.
When options are saved to a file,
the first check box in the dialogue specifies if
the full document and option file names are to be displayed.
If the files are not found in the current directory, the WGMLUI
program will redisplay these names with the full path name when
this check box is selected.
:P.
The second check box will cause the name of the output document file
to be displayed on the main document screen.
The third check box reduces the number of hotspots on the main document
screen.
All functions are still available from the menu bar.
The fourth check box specifies if
the document file name is saved with the options.
The fifth check box specifies the method for printing files when
more than one copy is requested.
If copy iteration is not selected, a print processor program must
be specified.
The name of the print file, printer port,
and the number of copies required are passed as command line
parameters to the program.
If copy iteration is selected, the print file is processed the number
of times specified by the print copies configuration value.
:P.
The three processor fields specify programs (or batch files) to run
when the &menu.Format&emenu., &menu.Edit File&emenu. or
&menu.Print&emenu. actions are selected.
When a print processor is not specified, a copy is performed by
the WGMLUI program.
The printer name field specifies the device or file name of the printer.
