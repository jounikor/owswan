The figure caption tag is used within a figure to specify the caption
for the figure.
The figure caption tag must be specified if the figure has an
identifier name associated with it.
Layout defined text followed by the figure number and a delimiter
is inserted before the caption text (the default text and delimiter
is "Figure" and a period).
The figure caption follows the main text of the figure.
