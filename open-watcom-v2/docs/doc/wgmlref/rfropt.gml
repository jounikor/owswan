The
:I2 refid='gropt'.file
:I1.file option
specified file is processed as a &WGML. command file.
:I1.command file
This file is composed of options normally specified
on the command line.
Command files are most useful when many options must be specified,
since they provide a way to specify these options without entering
them individually each time &WGML. is run.
Command line records in a command file may
include other command file invocations.
The default file type for a command file depends on the specific
computer system on which &WGML. is being run.
:P.
When working on a PC/DOS system, the DOS environment symbol
:HP2.GMLLIB:eHP2. is used to locate the command file if it
is not in the current directory
(see :HDREF refid='pcldef'.).
If it is still not found, the document include
path is searched (see :HDREF refid='incltag'.).

:eDL.
:P.
When a font is selected for output, the total line height for the
font has two components.
The first component is the height of the characters in the font,
and is fixed by the design of the character set.
The second component is a value to create space between lines of a
font.
Although the line spacing has an optimal value for each font height,
it can be modified to adjust the overall look of the document.
Both of the line height components are specified as point values
(there are 72 points in one inch),
with a decimal portion in hundredths of a point (ie. 10.25).
:P.
The font-space attribute is optional, and overrides the default
space value defined for the font.
This attribute may be specified for any type of character font.
:P.
The font-height attribute is specified with scaled fonts.
Scaled fonts have no predetermined character heights,
and must be defined with a height before they can be used.
The font-space attribute must also be specified, but can be
a null('') value to set the default font spacing.

If a layout is specified, it is only processed the first
time the document is processed.
:P.
Symbol values are separated by commas.
Each value may be enclosed in
single (') or double (") quotes.
The quotation
marks surrounding the text are not
part of the symbol value. If a
quotation mark of the same type
used to delimit the symbol value is to
be part of the symbol text, it can
be entered by specifying the quote
character twice. Only one quote
character will appear in the resulting
symbol value. A symbol value must be quoted
if it contains a comma.
:P.
The blanks outside quotations, or if the value is not quoted, the
blanks before the first and after
the last nonblank character, are not
considered part of the symbol value.
For example, <,,>, <,~b~b~b,>,
<,end_of_record>, or empty records
all specify empty symbol values.
:P.
Each symbol value in an input record is assigned to a special symbol
name.
The values are assigned to VALUE1, VALUE2, etc.
For example, if the values file contains the following,
:XMP.
"John Doe","13 Country Lane","Canada"
