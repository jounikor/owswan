The :hp2.pg:ehp2.
:I2 refid='gapg'.gapg
attribute determines the way in which the
page number for the index entry is presented.
If the attribute value is :hp1.start:ehp1., the index entry
will have a page range.
The :hp1.end:ehp1. attribute value on an index entry will
mark the end of a previously started page range.
The attribute value :hp1.major:ehp1. makes the page number
reference of higher priority than the other
page references in the index entry, and causes it to be
listed first.
If a character string is specified as the attribute value,
the character string is placed in the index
instead of a page number.
