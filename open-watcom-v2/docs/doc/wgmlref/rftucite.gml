:H2.Citations
:pc.Citations are used to refer to titles of books.
:I1.citations
Although the highlighting tags
could be used to emphasize the title,
the use of the citation entity means that &WGML.
can process the title in a different manner than the regular
highlighting tags.
The following figure illustrates a citation&gml.
:fig place=inline frame=box.
  :INCLUDE file='rfgcite'.

:p.A citation starts with a :hp2.&gml.cit:ehp2.
:I2 refid='ttcit'.ttcit
tag and is completed by an :hp2.&gml.ecit:ehp2.
:I2 refid='ttecit'.ttecit
tag.
For each :hp2.&gml.cit:ehp2. tag there must be a
corresponding :hp2.&gml.ecit:ehp2. tag.
Note that there are two periods after the :HP2.&gml.ecit:eHP2.
tag.
The first period ends the tag.
The second period is text to end the sentence.
:P.
The same restrictions apply to citations as were given with
highlighting; citations should not be given where the GML
layout determines the emphasis given to a phrase.
