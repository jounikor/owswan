:H2.Augmented Device Definitions
:I1.augmented devices
:P.
Certain device operations are not selectable through
the device and driver definitions.
&WGML. augments some device definitions by directly
supporting these operations.
:P.
The augmented device definitions are recognized by
the starting characters of the driver name.
For example, :HP2.HPLDRV:EHP2. is recognized
as the name of a driver definition for the HP LaserJet printer.

of decipoints instead of dots.
