:p.
The :hp2.compact:ehp2. attribute indicates that the
:I2 refid='gacompa'.gacompa
list items should be compacted.  Blank lines that
are normally placed between the list items will be suppressed.
The compact attribute is one of the few &WGML. attributes which
does not have an attribute value associated with it.
