:P.
The GML tutorial shows you
how to use the GML language with &WGML..
You are encouraged to try the examples as they are introduced.
Trying variations of the examples will also help in understanding
the GML language.
:P.
The tutorial does not describe every feature of the GML language.
The intent is to "get you going"; once some familiarity with
the language has been achieved, the reference section may be
used to obtain complete details about other parts of the language.
:P.
Do not be concerned with the style of the document while you are
learning the GML language.
One of the benefits of GML is the
ability to change the style of a document after it has been entered.
The document style is defined by the layout feature in &WGML.,
and is described in a later chapter.
:P.
Since any editor capable of creating and modifying text files
may be used to prepare the GML input,
this manual does not describe the use of a specific editor.
It is recommended that you become familiar with the use
of the editor before attempting the examples in this
chapter.

:P.It is worthwhile attempting to create a simple document at this
point.
The document should consist of a number of paragraphs.
Include a sufficient amount of text so that more than one page of
output is generated.
&WGML. will automatically format the document into pages.
With some experimentation, it may also be noted
that &WGML. will not create a page in which only the first
line of a paragraph occurs at the bottom of the page. When this
situation arises, the entire paragraph is placed on the
succeeding page.
This is called
:HP2.widowing:eHP2. (widows are lonely items which appear
:I1.widowing
all by themselves; &WGML. attempts to prevent widows as it formats
documents).
