Long Quotation

   This  will  serve as an  example of a
long quotation.    Suppose the following
came from a memo:

     Wes has  often said to us, "Never
  do   a   project    within   another
  project."

     We  have often  replied, "We need
  the second project to accomplish the
  first.   You  wouldn't  want  us  to
  operate 'in a technological vacuum',
  would you?"

That sums it pretty well.
