.chap CauseWay Services
.*
.np
The following information describes the services available through
CauseWay for low-level protected mode compatible functions and interrupt
servicing.
.np
The CauseWay services support both 16- and 32-bit selectors. Use of
32-bit selectors allows developers to directly access many megabytes of
memory in a CauseWay program using only one selector value.  In addition
to the normal segment registers used in real mode programs, the
additional segment registers FS and GS are always available for use by
developers to access memory.  Refer to a 386, 486, Pentium or compatible
CPU reference book or manual for more information on 386+ level registers and
instructions.
.*
.section Internal Operation
.*
.np
A valid protected mode selector:offset is placed in the PSP at offset
34h for the file handle list pointer. Note that the default value in the
program's PSP will point to the real mode PSP, not the protected mode
PSP, even if the handle count is less than or equal to twenty. Code that
makes use of the handle list should use the address at PSP+34h rather
than assuming the list's position within the PSP.  Also, when an
application is operating in non-DPMI conditions the handle table will
have an entry for CauseWay's VMM swap file.
.np
The GetMem and GetMem32 calls with CX:DX and ECX set to -1 will report
the largest free memory block, rather than total free memory.  This
value may be substantially lower than total free memory due to
fragmentation of the linear memory blocks.  Set CX to -1 (0FFFFH) and DX
to -2 (0FFFEH) or ECX to -2 (0FFFFFFFEH) for GetMem and GetMem32,
respectively, for the total free memory value.
.*
.section Functions
.*
.np
.ix 'DPMI'
The CauseWay functions are based on the DPMI specification and offer
additional enhancements. This means that several of the DPMI 1.0
functions are available to the CauseWay programmer in all systems
providing access to lower level functions should you need them. All DPMI
0.9 functions are always available.
.*
.section CauseWay API
.*
.np
CauseWay provides an API for C and assembly language programmers as an
extension of the DPMI API via INT 31h.  Including the file CW.INC allows
easy access to this API through appropriately named functions.  You may
also call the CauseWay API directly with appropriate register setup.
.np
.ix 'DPMI host'
CauseWay also provides all of the DPMI 0.9 API services on systems
without a true DPMI server (thus CauseWay itself is the DPMI host in
such situations).
.np
.ix 'register list'
Some of the API services require pointers to a real mode register list.
The format of this list follows:
.millust begin
dword     EDI
dword     ESI
dword     EBP
dword     Reserved
dword     EBX
dword     EDX
dword     ECX
dword     EAX
word      Flags
word      ES
word      DS
word      FS
word      GS
word      IP
word      CS
word      SP
word      SS
.millust end
The values are passed to the target routine without any interpretation
of their contents.  There is no need to set the high words of the
extended register entries unless the target routine requires them.
.*
.section Stack Frames
.*
.np
Stack frames for 16-bit interrupts are the same as for real mode.
.np
The stack frame for 16-bit exceptions follows:
.millust begin
word SS
word SP       - Original stack address
word Flags
word CS
word IP       - Original Flags:CS:IP values
word Err Code - Processor supplied exception error code
word CS
word IP       - Return address, returns to
                interrupt/exception dispatch code
.millust end
.*
.section Default API
.*
.np
.ix 'CauseWay API'
The default CauseWay API follows.  Functions that include the text
.mono near
are intended only for backwards compatibility with CauseWay's near
memory model.  This model is now obsolete.  The assembly language
include file *CW.INC* also contains this list.

.note Notes:
If the error file name is invalid when a fault occurs,
CauseWay defaults to using the standard CW.ERR file name in the current
directory.  The file name including any path and drive must not exceed
80 characters or it will be truncated.  CX:EDX are not checked for
validity and passing invalid values may cause a fault within the DOS
extender.  The ASCIIZ name pointed to by CX:EDX is copied to an internal
DOS extender location and may be safely modified after calling the
CWErrName function.

the PSP value to INT 21h, AH=50h before makeing additional memory requests
and then reset to the origional PSP the memory allocated will be released
when the PSP is released.

8K and uses memory that would otherwise be wasted. This default is
sufficient for most file I/O but if you are writing a program that

own larger buffer and pass the buffer's address to CauseWay to speed
file I/O.

.note Notes:
If the size of the block requested is greater than 64KB
bytes (BX >1000h) then contiguous descriptors are allocated.  If more
than one descriptor is allowed under 32-bit applications, the limit of
the first descriptor is set to the size of the entire block.  All
subsequent descriptors have a limit of 64KB except for the final
descriptor which has a limit of block size modulo 64KB. For 16-bit

.note Notes:
This function allocates a block of memory with an
associated selector:offset.  The allocation does not consume a selector
on each call as does GetMem because a non-zero offset from an existing
selector for this allocation type is returned.  GetMemSO is useful for
applications which make a large number of allocations where running out
of selectors with GetMem could be a problem.  A potential drawback is
that memory accesses beyond the allocation boundary may go undetected
since the selector is shared among several allocations.  Also, resizing
the block can change the selector:offset of the block.

The CauseWay API memory allocation functions
allocate memory from two sources.  Allocation requests below the value
returned by this function are allocated from a memory pool controlled
via conventional style MCB's. Requests above this value are allocated
via the normal DPMI functions. Because DPMI memory is always allocated
in multiples of pages (4KB) it can become very inefficient for any program
that needs to allocate small blocks of memory. The value set by this function
controls the size of memory chunks that will be allocated to and managed
by the MCB system.

A value of zero can be passed to this function to
disable the MCB allocation system.

The value passed will be rounded up to the

.section API Notes
.*
.np
A fixed segment selector at 40h is always available to the application.
This selector maps the real mode memory at 400h where most of the BIOS
variables can be found.  CauseWay also provides selectors at standard
video addresses 0B000h, 0B800h and 0A000h in non-DPMI environments to
ease conversion of real mode code.
.np
The environment variable block address in the Program Segment Prefix
(PSP) is a valid protected mode selector.  A valid protected mode
selector:offset is also placed in the PSP at offset 34h for the file
handle list pointer. Note that the default value in the program's PSP
will point to the real mode PSP, not the protected mode PSP, even if the
handle count is less than or equal to twenty. Code that makes use of the
handle list should use the address at PSP+34h rather than assuming the
list's position within the PSP.  Also, when an application is operating
non-DPMI conditions the handle table will have an entry for CauseWay's
VMM swap file.
.np
DOS functions which use the obsolete file control blocks (FCBs) are not
supported by CauseWay, although such support may be added by the developer.
.np
CauseWay applications should terminate using INT 21H function 4Ch. As
with real mode operation, the error level passed to this function in the
AL register is returned to the parent program or DOS.
.np
If a CauseWay application needs to terminate and stay resident (TSR),
then INT 21H function 31h may be used.  Unlike real mode operation, no
memory value is required for this function.  All memory owned by the
application when the TSR function is issued remains the program's
property.   There is currently no way of removing the CauseWay
application from memory once it becomes a TSR without rebooting the
machine or using a third party TSR manager.  However, a TSR manager will
not automatically release extended memory allocated for the CauseWay TSR.
.np
Unhandled exceptions terminate the program with a register display dump
to screen and a text file called CW.ERR.  CW.ERR contains other
potentially useful information about the state of the application when
it terminated.  Refer to the appendices for more information on the
CW.ERR file information format.
.np
CauseWay runs applications at privilege level 3.  Privilege level 0
reserved instructions will cause a general protection fault (GPF).
CauseWay emulates the four instructions MOV EAX,CR0; MOV CR0,EAX; MOV
EAX,CR3; and MOV CR3,EAX in the GPF handler so that they may be used by
an application.
.np
CauseWay will match a DPMI 0A00h function call with target string
RATIONAL/4G.  This in conjunction with CR0 emulation allows support of
floating point emulation by an exception handler.  Watcom uses this
approach under DOS/4GW operation if the floating point emulation library
is not linked in.  Note that this routine does not work for either
CauseWay or DOS/4GW under a DPMI host such as Windows or OS/2.
.*
.chap Interrupt Services
.*
.section Extended or Altered Interrupt Services
.*
.np
The size of registers used by CauseWay's extended or modified interrupt
services depends on the limit of the selector. Extended 32-bit registers
are used for 32-bit sized selectors and 16-bit registers are used for
selectors within 16-bits.  To reflect this, the convention of an [E] in
brackets is used before a listed register when it must be a 32-bit value
with a 32-bit selector and a 16-bit value with a 16-bit selector.
.np
Required registers that are not specified in this list should be set up
in the same way as required for normal DOS real mode operation. For INT
APIs that are not listed and require segemnt pointers, either handle
them using the CauseWay IntXX function or create your own interrupt
translation code.

.np
INT 23h   Control-C Handler Address
.np
This interrupt is always reflected back to the protected mode handler to
ensure the CauseWay application can handle it correctly. The default
handler aborts the application in the same manner as DOS. If you need to
terminate your application in your own handler, perform an INT 21h
AH=4ch as normal.
.np
INT 24h   Critical Error Handler Address
.np
This interrupt is always reflected back to the protected mode handler to
ensure the CauseWay application can handle it correctly. The default
handler behaves in the same way as the DOS handler and it aborts your
application, if appropriate. If you install your own handler, all memory
accessed by this interrupt as code or data must be locked.
.np
The register values normally placed on the stack by DOS before entry to
the interrupt handler are not present in protected mode. Only the
register values are valid. You may terminate your application from
within this interrupt with INT 21h, AH=4ch as normal.

Notes:
.np
With the exception of software interrupts that require segment pointers
as parameters, all interrupts can be issued as normal. The most common
interrupt APIs that require segment pointers are intercepted by CauseWay
to provide normal access to these services. Any other real mode
interrupt services that require segment pointers can be accessed using
CauseWay's simulated real mode interrupt/far call services.
.np
Hardware interrupts are always reflected to protected mode handlers even
when signaled during real mode operations. This ensures that protected
mode applications always retain control without requiring you to patch
real mode interrupt vectors. The remaining interrupts are serviced via
the vector table appropriate to the mode. Use the real to protected mode
callback services to provide real mode code with access to protected
mode code, and allow any interrupt to be re-signaled in protected mode.
.np
If you add your own hardware interrupt handlers, suchas the timer tick
at vector 08h, any memory that the handler reads or writes, including
its code, must reside in locked memory. (CauseWay provides a locked
stack.) This limitation is required because DOS is not re-entrant and
hardware interrupts can occur at any time. Interrupts occurring during
DOS activity prevent CauseWay's virtual memory manager from accessing
its swap file. Lock memory will not move to the swap file.

.chap Troubleshooting
.*
.section First Steps
.*
.np
If you have problems using CauseWay, first try linking and running a
one-line program that simply prints "Hello" on your computer screen.
This will help establish if the problem is a basic incompatibility with
CauseWay and your system setup, or if the error may lie elsewhere (e.g.
a third party library).
.np
The remainder of this chapter provides a description of error and
warning messages that you may encounter when using CauseWay.  Suggested
solutions to correct the errors are included where possible.
.*
.section DOS Extender Error Messages and Return Values
.*
.np
DOS extender error messages are displayed by the CauseWay DOS extender
when a CauseWay application is running and encounters a serious problem
that it cannot recover from.  The DOS extender then terminates the
application with the appropriate return code, displaying a dump of
register values, and writing system information to the file CW.ERR.
.np
.errsect
.errnote 01 Unable to resize program memory block.
.np
Generated if DOS reports an error when CauseWay tries to resize
its real mode memory block.  As the block is always shrunk, the only
possible cause of this is corrupted memory control blocks (MCBs).
Reboot the system to correct this error.
.np
.errnote 02 386 or better required.
.np
Generated if CauseWay is run on any machine with a processor
below a 386SX.  To correct this error, run the application on another
machine or upgrade the machine's processor.
.np
.errnote 03 Non-standard protected mode program already active.
.np
Generated if the system is already operating under the control
of another protected mode program which doesn't conform to either VCPI
or DPMI standards.  Identify and remove the other application before
running the CauseWay application.
.np
.errnote 04 DOS 3.1 or better required.
.np
Generated if DOS version is less than 3.1.  You need to upgrade
the machine's DOS version or use another machine to operate the CauseWay
application.
.np
.errnote 05 Not enough memory for CauseWay.
.np
Generated if the system doesn't have enough free physical
memory to initialize the CauseWay kernel code and data. Free additional
memory before running the CauseWay application.  The memory can be any
of the extended or conventional types supported by CauseWay.
.np
.errnote 06 VCPI failed to switch into protected mode.
.np
Generated if a VCPI server is detected and the server fails to
switch into protected mode when requested.  The only likely cause of
this error is a corrupted system.  Reboot the system and try again.
.np
.errnote 07 Unable to control A20.
.np
Generated if CauseWay detects an A20 line that doesn't respond
to the normal control methods.  This may indicate either a hardware
fault or a nonstandard system.  There is no software solution for these
hardware problems.  Installing an XMS driver such as HIMEM.SYS should
address nonstandard systems.
.np
.errnote 08 Selector allocation error.
.np
Generated if DPMI refuses to allocate enough selectors for
CauseWay to function.  Remove one or more programs that are also using DPMI.
.np
.errnote 09 Unrecoverable exception. Program terminated.
.np
This is the standard General Protection Fault, or GPF,
message.  It is generated if a nonrecoverable exception occurs which
suggests a bug in the application.  Use the register dump displayed with
this message along with the information in CW.ERR and the program's .MAP
file to help track down the location and cause of the problem.
.np
.errnote 10 Unable to find application to load.
.np
Generated if CauseWay is unable to find the application within
the executable .EXE file.  This situation indicates a corrupted file.
Rebuild or obtain another copy of the application.
.np
.errnote 11 DOS reported error while accessing application.
.np
Generated if any kind of error is detected while accessing the
CauseWay application executable file.  This situation indicates a
corrupted or missing file.  Rebuild or obtain another copy of the
application.
.np
.errnote 12 Not enough memory to load application.
.np
Generated if CauseWay is unable to provide enough memory to
load the application.  Free additional memory and/or disk space before
running the application.  Check for CAUSEWAY=SWAP, TEMP and TMP
environment variables that point to a disk with little free space.  If
running under an operating system that provides DPMI per application,
increase the application's DPMI allocation.
.np
.errnote 13 DPMI failed to switch to protected mode.
.np
Generated if the machine is using a DPMI server and it fails to
switch to protected mode.  If the DPMI server only supports multiple
clients of the same type (either 16- or 32-bit) then the problem is
probably that different types of applications are already being run.
Remove the other type of DPMI application(s) before running the CauseWay
application.
.np
.errnote 14 Memory structures destroyed. Program terminated.
.np
Generated if internal memory management structures become
corrupted.  This is caused by the CauseWay application writing to memory
regions that have not been allocated to it and is a bug in the
application.  Obtain a corrected version of the application to fix this
error.
.np
.errnote 15 DOS reported an error while accessing swap file. Program terminated.
.np
Generated if any level of error is detected while accessing the
swap file.  The swap file has probably been deleted inadvertently by the
application or perhaps marked as read-only.
.np
.errnote 16 Unsupported DOS function call. Program terminated.
.np
The CauseWay application attempted to use an obsolete DOS
function which used file control blocks (FCBs).  Use the file handle DOS
functions in the application instead.
