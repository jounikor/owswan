The &funcb function converts a 32-bit far pointer to a 16-bit far
pointer.
The 16-bit pointer is created by simply removing the high word of the
offset of the 32-bit pointer.
.np
The 32-bit far pointer must be one that was obtained by using
.kw MK_FP32
to extend a 16-bit pointer.
.np
This is useful whenever it is necessary to pass a 16-bit far pointer a
parameter to a Windows function though an _16 function.

.return begin
The &funcb returns a 16-bit far pointer.
