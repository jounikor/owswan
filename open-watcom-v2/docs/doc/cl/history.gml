.ix 'history'
.pp
The C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972
for the UNIX operating system.
Over the years, the language has appeared on many other systems,
satisfying a need of programmers who want to be able to develop
applications that can run in many different environments.
.pp
Because the C language was never formally defined, each implementation
interpreted the behavior of the language in slightly different ways,
and also introduced their own extensions. As a result, the goal of
true software portability was not achieved.
.pp
In 1982, the American National Standards Committee formed the X3J11
Technical Committee on the C Programming Language, whose purpose was
to formally define the C language and its library functions, and to
describe its interaction with the execution environment.
The C Programming Language standard was completed
in 1989.

The &wcboth. compiler has evolved from 8086 code generation technology
developed and refined at WATCOM International and the University of Waterloo
since 1980.
The first &wc286. compiler was released in 1988.
The first &wc386. compiler was released in 1989.
