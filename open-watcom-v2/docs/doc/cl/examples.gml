.pp
This chapter presents a series of examples of declarations of objects
and functions. Along with each example is a description that indicates
how to read the declaration.
.pp
This chapter may be used as a "cookbook" for declarations.
Some complicated but commonly required
declarations are given here.
.pp
The first examples are very simple, and build in complexity.
Some of the examples given near the end of each section are unlikely
to ever be required in a real program, but hopefully they will provide
an understanding of how to read and write C declarations.
.pp
To reduce the complexity and to better illustrate how a small difference
in the declaration can mean a big difference in the meaning, the
following rules are followed:
.autonote
.note
if an object is being declared, it is called
.mono x
or
.mono X
.ct ,
.note
if a function is being declared, it is called
.mono F
.ct ,
.note
if an object is being declared, it usually has type
.kw int
.ct , although any other type may be substituted,
.note
if a function is being declared, it usually returns type
.kw int
.ct , although any other type may be substituted.
.endnote
.pp
Storage class specifiers (
.ct .kw extern
.ct ,
.kw static
.ct ,
.kw auto
or
.kw register
.ct ) have purposely been omitted.
