.ix 'expression'
.ix 'operator'

.pp
An
.us expression
is a sequence of operators and operands that
describes how to,
.begbull $compact
.bull
calculate a value (eg. addition)
.bull
create side-effects (eg. assignment, increment)
.endbull
.pc
or both.
.pp
The order of execution of the expression is usually determined by
a mixture of,
.autonote
.note
.ix 'parentheses'
parentheses
.mono ()
.ct , which indicate to the compiler the desired grouping
of operations,
.note
.ix 'precedence'
.ix 'priority of operators'
.ix 'operator' 'priority'
.ix 'operator' 'precedence'
the precedence of operators, which describes the relative priority
of operators in the absence of parentheses,
.note
the common algebraic ordering,
.note
the associativity of operators.
.ix 'operator' 'associativity'
.ix 'associativity of operators'
.endnote
.pp
In most other cases, the order of execution is determined by the
compiler and may not be relied upon. Exceptions to this rule are
described in the relevant section.
Most users will find that the order of execution is well-defined
and intuitive.
However, when in doubt, use parentheses.
.pp
The table below summarizes the levels of precedence in expressions.
.im orderop
.im orddesc
.pp
An
.us exception
occurs when the operands for an operator are invalid. For example,
division by zero may cause an exception.
If an exception occurs, the behavior is undefined.
If an exception is a possibility, the program should be prepared
to handle it.
.pp
In the following sections, a formal syntax is used to describe
each level in the precedence table. This syntax is used in order
to completely describe the relationships between the various levels.
.*
.section Lvalues
.*
.pp
In order to understand certain components of expressions,
it is important to understand
the term
.ix 'lvalue'
.us lvalue
.period
.pp
An
.us lvalue
is an expression that designates an object.
The simplest form of
.us lvalue
is an identifier which is an object
(for example, an integer).
.pp
The type of the expression
may not be
.kw void
or a function. The term
.us lvalue
is derived from
.us l
.ct eft
.us value,
which refers to the fact that an
.us lvalue
is typically on the left side of an assignment expression.
.pp
If
.mono ptr
is a pointer to a type other than
.kw void
or a function, then both
.mono ptr
and
.mono *ptr
are
.us lvalues.
.pp
A
.ix 'lvalue' 'modifiable'
.ix 'modifiable lvalue'
.us modifiable lvalue
is an
.us lvalue
whose type is not an array or an incomplete type,
whose declaration does not contain the keyword
.kw const
.ct , and, if it is a structure or union,
then none of its members contains the keyword
.kw const

.keep end
.pp
A
.us postfix-expression
followed by parentheses containing zero or more comma-separated
expressions is a
.us function-call-expression
.period
The postfix-expression denotes the function to be called, and must
evaluate to a pointer to a function.
.* returning
.* .kw void
.* or returning an object other than an array.
The simplest form of this expression is an identifier which is the name
of a function. For example,
.mono Fn()
calls the function
.mono Fn.
.pp
The expressions within the parentheses
denote the arguments to the function.
If a function
prototype has been declared, then the number of arguments must match
the parameter list in the prototype, and the arguments are converted
to the types specified in the prototype.
.pp
If the postfix-expression is simply an identifier, and no function
prototype declaration for that identifier
is in scope, then an implicit,
.cillust begin
.mono extern int
identifier:MONO.():eMONO.:MSEMI.
.cillust end
.pc
declaration is placed in the innermost block containing the
function call. This declares the function as having external
linkage,
.ix 'external linkage'
.ix 'linkage' 'external'
no information about its parameters is available, and the function
returns an integer.
.pp
The expressions are evaluated (in an undefined order) and the values
assigned to the parameters for the function. All arguments are passed
by value, allowing the function to modify its parameters without
affecting
the arguments used to create the parameters. However, an argument
can be a pointer to an object, in which case the function may
modify the object to which the pointer points.
.pp
If a function prototype is in scope at both a call to a function
and its definition (and if the prototypes are the same), then the
compiler will ensure that the required number and type of parameters
are present.
.pp
If no function prototype is in scope at a call to a function,
then the
.us default argument promotions
are performed.
(Integral types such as
.kw char
and
.kw short int
are converted to
.kw int
.ct , while
.kw float
values are converted to
.kw double
.period
.ct )
When the function definition is encountered, if the parameter
types do not match the default argument promotions, then
the behavior is undefined. (Usually, the parameters to the function
will receive incorrect values.)
.pp
If a function prototype has been declared at a call to a function,
then each argument is converted, as if by assignment, to the type
of the corresponding parameter. When the function definition is
encountered, if the types of the parameters do not match the types
of the parameters in the function prototype, the behavior is
undefined.
.pp
If the
.ix 'ellipsis'
ellipsis (
.ct .mono ,...
.ct ) notation is used in a function prototype,
then those arguments in a function call that correspond to the
ellipsis have only the default argument promotions performed on
them.
(See the chapter "Functions" for a complete description of the
ellipsis notation.)
.pp
Function calls may be
..ix 'function' 'recursion'
..ix 'recursion'
recursive.
Functions
may call themselves either directly, or via other functions.
.pp
The following are some examples of function calls:
.millust begin
putchar( 'x' );
chr = getchar();
valid = isdigit( chr );
printf( "chr = %c, valid = %2x\n", chr, valid );
fnptr = &MyFunction;

.ix 'dot operator'
.ix 'operator' 'dot'
.ix 'operator' '.'
must be an object with a structure or union type. The second operand
must be the name of a member of that type.

first operand is also an lvalue.
.pp
The first operand of the
.mono ->

.ix 'arrow operator'

.uillust end
.keep end
.pp
The operand of post-increment and post-decrement must be a modifiable
lvalue, and a scalar (not a structure, union or array).
.pp
The effect of the operation is that
the operand is incremented or decremented by 1, adjusted for the
type of the operand. For example, if the operand is declared to be
a "pointer to
.us type
.ct ", then the increment or decrement will be by the value
.monoon
sizeof(&SYSRB.:HP1.type:eHP1.&SYSRB.)
.monooff
.period
.pp
The result of both post-increment and post-decrement (if it is just
a subexpression of a larger expression)
is the original,
unmodified value of the operand.
In other words, the original value of the operand is used in the
expression, and then it is incremented or decremented.
Whether the operand is incremented immediately after use or after
completion of execution of the expression is undefined. Consider the
statements,
.millust begin
int i = 2;
int j;

j = (i++) + (i++);
.millust end
.pc
Depending on the compiler,
.mono j
may get the value 4 or 5. If the increments are delayed until after
the expression is evaluated,
.mono j
gets the value
.monoon
2&SYSRB.+&SYSRB.2.
.monooff
If the increment of
.mono i
happens immediately after its value is retrieved, then
.mono j
gets the value
.monoon
2&SYSRB.+&SYSRB.3.

When an expression is preceded by a type name
in parentheses, the value of the expression is converted to the
named type. This is called a
.ix 'cast operator'
.ix 'operator' 'cast'
.ix 'converting types explicitly'
.us cast.
Both the type name and the operand type must be scalar (not a
structure, union or array), unless the type name is
.kw void
.period
If the type name is
.kw void
.ct , the operand type must be a complete type
(not an array of unknown size, or a structure or union that has
not yet been defined).
.pp
A cast does not yield an lvalue.
.pp
Pointers may be freely converted from "pointer to
.ix 'pointer' 'to void'
.ix 'void' 'pointer to'
.kw void
.ct " to any other pointer type without
using an explicit cast operator.
Pointers also may be converted
from any pointer type to "pointer to
.kw void
.ct ".
.pp
A pointer may be converted to a pointer to another type.
However,
the pointer may be invalid
if the resulting pointer is not properly
.ix 'alignment'
aligned for
the type.
Converting a pointer to a pointer to a type with less strict
alignment, and back again, will yield the same pointer.
However, converting it to a pointer to a type with more strict
alignment, and back again, may yield a different pointer.
On many computers, where alignment is not required (but may improve
performance), conversion of pointers may take place freely.

.ix 'operator' '?'
.us conditional
operator, and the
.mono :
symbol separates the
second and third parts.
The first operand must have a scalar type (not a structure, union or
array).
.pp
The first operand is evaluated. If its value is not equal to zero,
then the second operand is evaluated and its value is the result.
Otherwise, the third operand is evaluated and its value is the result.
.pp
Whichever operand is evaluated, the other is not evaluated. Any side
effects that might have happened during the evaluation of the other
operand do not happen.
.pp
If both the second and third operands have arithmetic type, then the
usual arithmetic conversions are performed on them, and the type of
the result is the same type as the converted operands.
.pp
If both operands have the same structure, union or pointer type,
then the result has that type.
.pp
If both operands are pointers, and one is
"pointer to
.kw void
.ct ", then the result type is "pointer to
.kw void
.ct ".
.pp
If one operand is a pointer, and the other is a null pointer constant
(0), the result type is that of the pointer.
.pp
If both operands are void expressions, then the result is a void
expression.
.pp
No other combinations of result types are permitted.
.pp
Note that, unlike most other operators, the conditional operator
associates from right to left.
For example, the expression,
.millust begin
a = b ? c : d ? e : f;
.millust end
.pc
is translated as if it had been parenthesized as follows:
.millust begin
a = b ? c : (d ? e : f);
.millust end
.pp
This construct is confusing, and so should probably be avoided.

In contexts where the comma is also used as a separator
(function argument lists and initializer lists),
a comma expression must be placed in parentheses.

.section Constant Expressions
.*
.ix 'constant expression'
.ix 'expression' 'constant'
.pp
A constant expression may be specified in several places:
.begbull $compact
.bull
the size of a
.ix 'bit-field'
bit-field member of a structure,
.bull
the value of an
.ix 'enumeration constant'
enumeration constant,
.bull
an
.ix 'initialization'
initializer list,
.bull
the number of elements in an
.ix 'array' 'specifying size'
array,
.bull
the value of a
.ix 'case label'
.kw case
label constant,
.bull
with the
.kwpp #if
and
.kwpp #elif
preprocessor directives.
.endbull
.pp
In most cases, a constant expression consists of a series of constant
values and operations that evaluate to a constant value.
Certain operations may only appear within the operand of the
.kw sizeof
operator. These include:
.begbull $compact
.bull
a function call,
.bull
pre- or post-increment or decrement,
.bull
assignment,
.bull
comma operator,
.bull
array subscripting,
.bull
the . and,
.mono ->
operators (structure member access),
.bull
the unary
.mono &
(address-of) operator (see exception below),
.bull
the unary
.mono *
(indirection) operator,
.bull
casts to a type other than an integer type.
.endbull
.pp
In a constant expression that is an initializer, floating-point
constants and casts may be specified. Objects that have
static storage duration, and function designators (names), may be
used to provide addresses, either explicitly using the unary
.mono &
(address-of) operator, or implicitly by specifying the
identifier only.
.pp
The following examples illustrate constant expressions that may
be used anywhere:
.millust begin
3
256*3 + 27
OPSYS == OS_DOS /* These are macro names */
.millust end
.pc
The next set of examples are constant expressions that are only valid
in an initializer:
.millust begin
&SomeObject
SomeFunction
3.5 * 7.2 / 6.5
.millust end
.pp
In a constant expression that is part of a
.ix 'constant expression' 'in #if or #elif'
.kwpp #if
or
.kwpp #elif
preprocessor directive,
.* the
.* .kw sizeof
.* operator, casts and enumeration constants may not be specified.
.* Since
.* .kw sizeof
.* can't be used, it follows that function calls, assignment, pre- and
.* post-increment and decrement, array indexing, structure member access,
.* address-of, indirection, casts, comma operator, and floating-point
.* numbers are not permitted.
.* Specifically,
only integral constants
and operators are permitted
(and macros that, when replaced,
follow these same rules).
