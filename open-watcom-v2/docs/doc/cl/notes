- at this point, WGML.EXE produces an almost-perfect book, except for:
    (1) the .PS file must be edited to remove the topodd "&amp.headtxt1"
        from the first page of each chapter of the appendix,
    (2) the .PS file must be edited to ADD the botodd and boteven "headtext2"
        section headings where they are otherwise blank.
- before sending the .PS file anywhere, the SHADE.PS and ULINE.PS files
  must be added to the front. SHADE.PS adds the functions required to shade
  rectangular areas. Without it, the .PS file cannot be processed due to
  missing functions. ULINE.PS replaces the Courier (mono) font underline
  character with a "skinny" version so that keywords and macros containing
  double underscores will not appear with one long underscore. This file is
  not required, but should be included.
- add "based pointers" and "pointers, based" to the index

As far as I know, the following accurately describes what the .PS files
contain:
    ORIG_C.PS   - original output from WGML, before above fixes
    FIXED_C.PS  - hand-edited PostScript file fixing (1) and (2) above
    CLANGREF.PS - FIXED_C.PS with SHADE.PS and ULINE.PS added to the front
    SHADED.PS   - the 40 pages containing shading extracted from FIXED_C.PS,
                  with SHADE.PS and ULINE.PS added to the front

================
Did some work to make a special version for Quantum. The following files
changed:
    C.GML           - added &targetQNX, include NEWSLETT conditionally
    COVER.GML       - chg'd WATCOM Pubs to WATCOM Int'l
    PREFACE.GML     - added Quantum's address using .if
    THANKS.GML      - chg'd date of message
    TRADEMRK.GML    - chg'd trademarks for UNIX and WATCOM

    NB\COPYRITE.GML - chg'd WATCOM Pubs to WATCOM Int'l
    NB\DISCLAIM.GML - chg'd WATCOM Pubs and Group to WATCOM Int'l

    FMT.BAT         - reflects new locations of things on disk

Also, CLANGQNX.PS was added to PSOUTPUT.ZIP. This file contains the shading
and skinny-underline prefixes. The body of the book is identical to the
WATCOM edition. The "Front Material" changed and was edited together with
CLANGREF.PS to avoid having to format the entire book and deal with potential
GML changes or having to re-edit the banners as described above.
