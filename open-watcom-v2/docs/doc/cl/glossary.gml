.*
.note alignment
.ix 'alignment'
On some computers, objects such as integers, pointers and
floating-point numbers may be stored only at certain addresses (for
example, only at even addresses). An attempt to reference an object
that is not properly aligned may cause the program to fail. Other
computers may not require alignment, but may suggest it in order to
increase the speed of execution of programs.
.pp
C compilers align all objects that require it, including putting
padding characters within structures and arrays, if necessary.
However, it is still possible for a program to attempt to reference an
improperly-aligned object.

.*
.note library function
.ix 'library function'
A library function is a function provided with the C compiler that
performs some commonly needed action. The C language standard
describes a set of functions that all C compilers must provide.
Whether or not the function actually generates a function call is
implementation-defined.
.*
.note line
.ix 'line'
A line is conceptually similar to a line as seen in a text editor. The
line in a text editor may be called a physical line. Several physical
lines may be joined together into one logical line (or just "line") by
ending all but the last line with a
.monoon
\
.monooff
symbol. C does not normally require statements to fit onto one
line, so using the
.monoon
\
.monooff
symbol is usually only necessary when defining
.ix 'macro'
.us macros.
.*
.note linkage
.ix 'linkage'
An object with
.us external
linkage may be referenced by any
.us module
in the program. An object with
.us internal
linkage may be referenced only within the module in which it is
defined. An object with :ITAL.no:eITAL. linkage may only be referenced
within the
.us block
in which it is defined.
.*
.note lint
.ix 'lint'
lint is a utility program, often provided with the compiler, which
detects problems that the compiler will accept as syntactically valid,
but likely are not what the programmer intended.
.*
.note lvalue
.ix 'lvalue'
An lvalue is an expression that designates an object. The term
originally comes from the assignment expression,
.millust L = R
in which the left operand
.mono L
to the assignment operator must be a modifiable value. The most common
form of lvalue is the identifier of an object.
.pp
If an expression
.mono E
evaluates to a pointer to an object, then
.mono *E
is an lvalue that designates the object to which
.mono E
points.
In particular, if
.mono E
is declared as a "pointer to
.kw int
.ct ", then both
.mono E
and
.mono *E
are lvalues having the respective types "pointer to
.kw int
.ct " and
.kw int
.period
.*
.note macro
.ix 'macro'
There are two kinds of macros. An object-like macro is an
.us identifier
that is replaced by a sequence of
.us tokens.
A function-like macro is an apparent function call which is replaced
by a sequence of tokens.
.*
.keep begin
.note module
.ix 'module'
Referred to in the C language standard as a
.us translation unit,
a module is usually a file containing C source code. A module may
include headers or other source files, and have conditional
compilation (preprocessing directives), object declarations, and/or
functions. A module is thus considered to be a C source file after the
included files and conditional compilation have been processed.
.* or the resulting
.* declarations of objects and functions.
.keep end
.*
.note name space
.ix 'name space'
A name space is a category of identifiers. The same identifier may
appear in different name spaces. For example, the identifier
.mono thing
may be a label, object name, tag and member of a structure or union,
all at the same time, since each of these has its own name space. The
syntax of the use of the identifier resolves which category the
identifier falls into.
.*
.note nesting
.ix 'nesting'
Nesting is placing something inside something else. For example, a
.kw for
statement may, as part of its body, contain another
.kw for
statement. The second
.kw for
is said to be nested inside the first. Another form of nesting occurs
when source files include other files.
.*
.note null pointer constant
.ix 'null pointer'
.ix 'pointer' 'null'
The value zero, when used in a place where a pointer type is expected,
is considered to be a null pointer constant, which is a value that
indicates that the pointer does not currently point to anything. The
compiler interprets the zero as a special value, and does not
guarantee that the actual value of the pointer will be zero.
.pp
The macro
.mkw NULL
is often used to represent the null pointer constant.
.*
.note null character
.ix 'null character'
The character with all
.us bits
set to zero is used to terminate
.us strings,
and is called the null character. It is represented by the
.us escape sequence
.mono \0
in a string, or as the character constant
.mono '\0'
.period
.*
.note object
.ix 'object'
An object is a collection of
.us bytes
in the storage of the computer, used to represent values. The size and
meaning of the object is determined by its
.us type.
A
.us scalar
object
is often referred to as a
.us variable.
.*
.note parameter
.ix 'parameter'
.ix 'argument'
A parameter to a function is a "local copy" of the argument values
determined in the call to the function. Any modification of a
parameter value does not affect the argument to the function call.
However, an argument (and hence a parameter) may be a pointer to an
object, in which case the function may modify the object to which its
parameter points.
.*
.note pointer
.ix 'pointer'
An object that contains the
.us address
of another object is said to be a pointer to that object.

.bull
includes or excludes input lines based on
.kwpp #if
directives
.endbull
.pc
before the compiler translates the source.

.ix 'recursion'
Recursion occurs when a
.us function
calls itself either directly, or by calling another function which
calls it. See recursion. (!)
.*
.note register
.ix 'register'
A register is a special part of the computer, usually not part of the
addressable storage. Registers may contain values and are generally
faster to use than storage.
.pp
The
.us keyword
.kw register
may be used when declaring an object with
.us automatic storage duration,
indicating to the compiler that this object will be heavily used, and
the compiler should attempt to optimize the use of this object,
possibly by placing it in a machine register.
.*
.note return value
.ix 'return value'
A return value is the value returned by a
.us function
via the
.kw return
statement.

.note scope
.ix 'scope'
The scope of an
.us identifier
identifies the part of the
.us module
that may refererence it. An object with
.us block
scope may only be referenced within the block in which it is defined.
An object with
.us file
scope may be referred to anywhere within the file in which it is
defined.
.*
.note sequence point
.ix 'sequence point'
A sequence point is a point at which all
.us side-effects
from previously executed statements will have been resolved, and no
side-effects from statements not yet executed will have occurred.
Normally, the programmer will not need to worry about sequence points,
as it is the compiler's job to ensure that side-effects are resolved
at the proper time.
.*
.note side-effect
.ix 'side-effect'
A side-effect modifies a value of an object, causing a change in the
state of the program. The most common side-effect is
.us assignment,
whereby the value of the left operand is changed.

for scanning the input source lines. Each identifier, constant and
comment is one token, while other characters are each, individually,
one token.
.*
.note type
.ix 'type'
The type of an
.us object
describes the size of the object, and what interpretation is to be
used when using the value of the object. It may include information
such as whether the value is
.kw signed
or
.kw unsigned
.ct , and what range of values it may contain.
.*
.note undefined behavior
.ix 'undefined behavior'
Undefined behavior occurs when an erroneous program construct or bad
data is used, and the standard does not impose a behavior. Possible
actions of undefined behavior include ignoring the problem, behaving
