.pp
Whenever two operands are involved in an operation,
some kind of
.ix 'conversion' 'type'
.ix 'type' 'conversion'
.us conversion
of one or both of the operands may take place.
For example, a
.kw short int
and a
.kw long int
cannot be directly added. Instead, the
.kw short int
must first be converted to a
.kw long int
.ct , then the two values can be added.
.pp
Fortunately, C provides most conversions as
.us implicit
operations. Simply by indicating that the two values
are to be added, the C compiler will check their types and
generate the appropriate conversions.
Sometimes it is necessary, however, to be aware of exactly
how C will convert the operands.
.pp
Conversion of operands always attempts to preserve
the value of the operand.
Where preservation of the value is not possible, the compiler will
sign-extend signed quantities and discard the high bits
of quantities being converted to smaller types.
.pp
The rules of type conversions are fully discussed in
the following sections.

If an unsigned integer is converted to an integer type of any size,
then, if the value can be represented in the new type, the value
remains unchanged.
.endnote
.pp
If an unsigned integer is converted to a longer type (type with greater
range), then the value will not change.
If it is converted to a type with a smaller range, then provided
the value can be represented in the smaller range, the value will
remain unchanged. If the value cannot be represented, then if
the result type is signed, the result is implementation-defined.
If the result type is
.kw unsigned
.ct , the result is the integer modulo (1+the largest unsigned number that
can be stored in the shorter type).

Whenever two values are used with a binary operator that expects
arithmetic types (integer or floating-point), conversions may
take place implicitly. Most binary operators work on two values of the
same type. If the two values have different types, then the type
with the smaller range is always promoted to the type with the
greater range. Conceptually, each type is found in the table below
and the type found lower in the table is converted to the type
found higher in the table.

.section Default Argument Promotion
.*
.ix 'default argument promotion'
.pp
When a call is made to a function, the C compiler checks to see if
the function has been defined already, or if a prototype for that
function has been found.
If so, then the arguments to the function are converted to the
specified types.
If neither is true, then the arguments to
the function are promoted as follows:
.begbull $compact
.bull
all integer types have the
.ix 'integral promotion'
.us integral promotions
performed on them, and,
.bull
all arguments of type
.kw float
are promoted to
.kw double
.period
.endbull
.pp
If the definition of the function does not have parameters with types that
match the promoted types, the behavior is undefined.
