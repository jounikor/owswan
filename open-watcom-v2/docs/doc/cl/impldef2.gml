The representations and ranges of the various kinds of integers.

.discuss begin
.pp
Integers are stored using 2's complement form.
The high bit of each
signed integer is a sign bit.
If the sign bit is 1, the value is
negative.

The ranges of the various integer types are described in the section
"Integer Types".

The result of converting an integer to a shorter signed integer
when the value cannot be accurately represented.
.bd off
.discuss begin
.pp
The high order bits of the longer value are discarded, and the remaining
bits are interpreted according to the new type.
.discuss end
.keep break
..sk 1 c
.bd on
The result of converting an unsigned integer to a signed integer
of the same type when the value cannot be accurately represented.

The results of bitwise operations on signed integers.

The sign bit is treated as any other bit during bitwise operations.

The result of a right shift of a negative-valued signed integer.
.bd off
.discuss begin
.pp
A right shift of a signed integer will leave the higher, vacated bits
with the original value of the high bit.
In other words, the sign bit
is propogated to fill bits vacated by the shift.
