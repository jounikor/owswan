.SH "NAME"
zip_stat , \- .Nm zip_stat_index
get information about file
.SH "LIBRARY"
libzip (-lzip)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.In zip.h
.Ft int
.Fn zip_stat "struct zip *archive" "const char *fname" "int flags" "struct zip_stat *sb"
.Ft int
.Fn zip_stat_index "struct zip *archive" "int index" "int flags" "struct zip_stat *sb"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.Fn zip_stat
function obtains information about the file named
\fBfname\fR
in
\fBarchive.\fR
The
\fBflags\fR
argument specifies how the name lookup should be done.
Its values are described in
zip_name_locate(3).
Also,
\fBZIP_FL_UNCHANGED\fR
may be
.I or'ed
to it to request information about the original file in the archive,
ignoring any changes made.
.PP
The
.Fn zip_stat_index
function obtains information about the file at position
\fBindex.\fR
.PP
The
\fBsb\fR
argument is a pointer to a
.Ft struct zip_stat
(shown below), into which information about the file is placed.
.Bd \-literal
struct zip_stat {
    const char *name;			/* name of the file */
    int index;				/* index within archive */
    unsigned int crc;			/* crc of file data */
    unsigned int size;			/* size of file (uncompressed) */
    time_t mtime;			/* modification time */
    unsigned int comp_size;		/* size of file (compressed) */
    unsigned short comp_method;		/* compression method used */
};
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error information in
\fBarchive\fR
is set to indicate the error.
.SH "ERRORS"
The function
.Fn zip_stat
can fail for any of the errors specified for the routine
zip_name_locate(3).
.PP
The function
.Fn zip_stat_index
fails and sets the error information to
.Er ZIP_ER_INVAL
if
\fBindex\fR
is invalid.
If
\fBZIP_FL_UNCHANGED\fR
is not set and no information can be obtained from the source
callback, the error information is set to
.Er ZIP_ER_CHANGED.
